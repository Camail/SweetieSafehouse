00:05:11 <skram> cecci has probably eaten plenty of rabbits dot
00:05:18 <DuB`> Cecci knows lots about animals, maybe less about the luxury textiles market around them...
00:05:20 <DuB`> Ye haha
00:10:16 <Dot|Phone> Well yes. I was talking about in context of luxury worked textile items
00:11:32 <skram> cecci has been pals with sil for long enough to be keenly aware of the importance of quality textiles probably
