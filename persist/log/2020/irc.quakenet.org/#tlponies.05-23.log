01:04:44 <Camail> Rawr|Fone  so i figured out the bannerlord trade rumors mechanic, it will keep track of the last ~3 cities you've been to
01:05:05 <Camail> so its not as broken as i thought, but its still very easy to establish a trade route for early game
01:05:25 <Camail> also there are other ways later on to get trade rumors
01:06:20 <Rawr|Fone> Hmm
01:06:43 <Rawr|Fone> Seems kinda weird anyway
01:06:59 <Rawr|Fone> I'll probably get the game next week
01:07:40 <Rawr|Fone> But that doesn't change with trade skill? 
01:12:52 <Camail> i am not entirely sure
01:13:25 <Camail> a big benefit of the trade skill is the feats you get
01:13:45 <Camail> at 75 you can gather trade rumors from caravans or workshops
01:23:48 <Camail> i'm constantly getting urges to play terraria, then immediately feeling exhausted by doing the same content i've done like 10 times

09:05:56 <Runbunny> Hai.
09:06:02 <Runbunny> reification, https://twitter.com/kanihamiso/status/1264066632302784512
09:06:58 <reification> lol
09:07:29 <reification> ascii art characters do commonly suffer from dismemberment
09:07:43 <reification> it is saturday morning, time for you to do mathematical estimation
09:08:13 <reification> without calculating, imagine you roll 6 dice (d6) once a day for 30 years
09:08:29 <reification> what is the chance you never see 6 sixes?
09:09:54 <Dot`> 1/6 ^ ((30 * 356) + 5)
09:09:59 <Runbunny> But Dot.
09:10:02 <Dot`> something like that
09:10:06 <Dot`> i really cant recall my statistacal math
09:10:06 <Runbunny> That is calculating.
09:10:09 <Dot`> maths
09:10:20 <Dot`> oh
09:10:22 <reification> yes dot you are well on the way to calculating
09:10:38 <reification> <reification> without calculating
09:10:41 <Dot`> my awnser without calcs is
09:10:49 <Dot`> none
09:11:12 <reification> interesting
09:11:20 <Dot`> i have just woken up
09:11:47 <Runbunny> It's very low that you don't see 6 sixes. 
09:12:12 <reification> ty dotties, bun. i wanted to get a feel for ppls expectations.
09:13:12 <reification> my calc says: (1-(1/6^6))^(30*365.25)=0.79
09:14:17 <reification> (i don't think all the brackets are needed, i should learn the order properly...)
09:15:43 <reification> oh i didn't get breakfast :/
09:15:46 <Dot`> odd way to account for leap years as they are complete days, your adding descrepincy in
09:15:58 <Dot`> too busy being a nerd
09:16:02 <reification> crumpet time
09:16:51 <reification> good enough for my inner engineer dot

09:25:46 <Dot`> i still feel that calc is off
09:26:19 <Dot`> but i also feel ive just woken up and its been years, so im probably wrong
09:27:39 <Dot`> would it not just be ((5/6) ^ (30*356.25))
09:28:28 <Dot`> which gives 2.2 x10^(-846)
09:29:39 <Dot`> you roll a d6 over 10000 times
09:31:57 <Dot`> cane, hahaha
09:32:02 <Dot`> now i want to play stalker......
09:32:17 <Cane> Isn't that cosplay uncanny?
09:32:34 <Dot`> i thought it was ingame at first....
09:32:44 <Dot`> was trying to figure out the title
09:36:25 <reification> dot that is rolling one dice a day for 30 years and not seeing a single six...
09:36:33 <reification> maybe you misread what i asked?
09:37:12 <Dot`> [10:08] <+reification> what is the chance you never see 6 sixes
09:37:18 <Dot`> is that a term i dont get then
09:37:27 <Dot`> i took that as any sixes
09:38:01 <Dot`> aahhhh
09:38:11 <Dot`> on the 10th read i get it
09:38:22 <Dot`> ive had some coffee now
09:38:25 <Dot`> haha

23:23:46 <skrma> same
23:24:54 <skrma> sometimes i almost forget that they're idols, runbun
23:25:11 <skrma> what with all of them being perverts and all
23:35:15 <Runbunny> It's like they're real people and not just some idol on a pedestal. Makes them feel more relatable.
23:37:04 <Runbunny> And that's why Pekora will always have a special place in my heart.
23:37:36 <skrma> as a fellow bunny
23:38:43 <Runbunny> I'd nibble on her carrots, if you know what I mean.
