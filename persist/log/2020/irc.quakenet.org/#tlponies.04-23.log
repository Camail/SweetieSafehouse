12:01:28 <Runbunny> Both the placebo and the nocebo effect is quite powerful actually. 
12:02:45 <Runbunny> If I recall one study found that even though people were told they were getting a placebo drug, it still had an effect compared to a controls.

13:37:45 <Runbunny> It was very disappointing.
13:42:03 <Rawr|Fone> I can see why
13:47:50 <Rawr|Fone> Maybe next time runbun
13:48:44 <Runbunny> Hopefully.
13:53:25 <DuB`> Runbunny
13:53:56 <DuB`> Got my full alpha and beta kulve sets, so pretty :D
13:54:06 <DuB`> But yeah I need that kjarr ice CB...
14:07:26 <Runbunny> Too bad it's RNG on top of RNG.
14:10:11 <DuB`> Can meld a bunch of weapons with the mats now, at least
14:10:12 <reification> embrace the rng bun, like using exusiai and gitano as your main damage and wondering why auto-replay often fails
14:13:51 <Runbunny> My melder didn't have that option :S
14:13:58 <Runbunny> Maybe I was looking at the wrong thing.
14:19:34 <DuB`> The armor is nice, I was able to make a full support build (free meal secret, wide range, speed eat) and still have maxed out crit eye, crit dmg, wex, focus, and health boost
14:19:36 <DuB`> crazy
14:20:09 <DuB`> ... and I find that you NEED to be a dedicated support to keep randoms from failing the kulve hunt :P
14:20:11 <DuB`> They drop like flies
