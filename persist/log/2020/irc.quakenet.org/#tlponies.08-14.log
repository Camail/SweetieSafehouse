09:58:48 <Runbunny> It's not bad, I just don't have any and I haven't bother to get any :P.
10:05:18 <Dot`> too many animes to watch

18:13:07 <Dot`> Hey cane
18:13:14 <Dot`> hope you have your friday pizza
18:13:16 <Cane> Doot.
18:13:28 <Cane> I'll be making some in an hour, how'd you know?
18:13:44 <Cane> Is there a camera in my kitchen?
18:15:40 <Dot`> i can sense it
18:19:32 <Dot`> whats going on the pizza?
18:26:14 <DuB`> Cane, I was happily making a big worldmap in Inkarnate and got a result I was pretty happy with after about 15 hours. Then I remembered you had posted a map you made at some point in Discord and went to go look at it...
18:26:45 <Cane> lol oh, this thing?
18:26:45 <Cane> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/112498538897776640/690097722392707138/Eventide_Map_-_Custom_Text.jpg
18:26:46 <DuB`> I immediately realized I'd been playing with the kiddie tools, and am now looking forward to a lovely 100 hours in wonderdraft and getting 1000x more detail in the map :P
18:26:56 <Dot`> Dub, im hoping this is for a homebrew world DnD game you plan to run
18:27:09 <DuB`> Maybe someday, that's not the plan. Maps are just fun!
18:27:24 <Cane> Yeah, I'm definitely advocating for Wonderdraft. Inkarnate is worse and is a subscription based model for an online website only, like wtf.
18:27:33 <Cane> Wonderdraft is actually a program you buy and download and own forever.
18:27:35 <Cane> And it's better.
18:27:37 <Cane> No contest.
18:28:34 <DuB`> I'd gotten to this point before realizing it was kinda the limit of the program -- https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/697233097951019089/742222501622317266/AB-Map.jpg
18:28:39 <Cane> Wonderdraft also has a Steam Workshop-style addon website where you can download a "mod manager" and various additional textures and the like.
18:28:48 <Cane> But most of them aren't that good yet.
18:28:54 <Cane> My map is 95% standard assets.
18:29:05 <Dot`> Those are nice maps
18:29:25 <Cane> That's better than I was expecting, DuB`.
18:29:30 <DuB`> Your care with mountain and ridge placements is an inspiration ;D
18:30:05 <Cane> <3
18:40:24 <DuB`> Spending friday afternoon fixing broken formulas in excel
18:40:30 <DuB`> Creating real value and earning my salary. Yes.
18:45:44 <Cane> Earlier this year I spent some time making a value and price calculator for Planet Coaster in Google Spreadsheets. Until then I hadn't done any real excel/sheet work and I wanted to learn.
18:45:47 <Cane> It was a great project.

22:58:34 <carcinisation> night all
22:59:42 <Runbunny> Goodnight Reif.
23:35:07 <Dot`> Runbun, how did the puzzle hunt go?
23:40:53 <Runbunny> It was all right. I was sweating a lot though, since you know it was above 23 degrees.
23:41:06 <Runbunny> Got 2x 100 piece ones.
23:41:56 <Runbunny> One with the motive of disneys the little mermaid and one with painting of a building at a city square I believe.
23:42:07 <Runbunny> 1000 piece ones.
23:42:32 <Dot`> 1000 is a bit more respectable than 100, i was about to question your puzzle skills
23:45:50 <Runbunny> :P
23:46:03 <Runbunny> A zero slipped away.
23:46:38 <Runbunny> It's not for me though, it's a gift for my cousin.
23:47:06 <DuB`> Wanted to be healthy, got small sushi dinner
23:47:10 <DuB`> But now I crave sweetes
23:47:43 <Runbunny> Have a big glass of water Dub.
23:48:33 <DuB`> I had two!
23:49:10 <DuB`> Maybe I pop down to the corner store for some bread and cleaning supplies, and if they haaaaappen to have a bunch of ice cream then we'll see...
23:50:09 <Runbunny> :D
