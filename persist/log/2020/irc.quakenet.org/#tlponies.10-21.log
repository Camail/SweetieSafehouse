22:11:02 <Runbunny> O:
22:12:32 <Runbunny> Dot`, look!
22:12:38 <Runbunny> Hob is wearing a helmet.
22:13:27 <Dot`> he does that when space shipping
22:13:37 <Dot`> OSHA
22:14:50 <reification> i started watching and it immediately is gone
22:16:23 <Runbunny> You have to be quick with Hob.
22:16:39 <Runbunny> The run will be over in a blink of the eye.
22:23:11 <Dot`> time for more helmet?
22:43:47 <reification> time for sleep
22:43:49 <reification> night all
22:43:54 <Camail> woo, beat hades
22:44:07 <Camail> i...didnt expect to beat it when i did
22:44:30 <Camail> but it was hella satisfying and the credits song was great
22:44:30 <Dot`> gnight reif
22:44:47 <Dot`> is there a actual ending cam?
22:44:58 <Camail> credits roll
22:45:02 <Camail> is all i will say
22:45:56 <Camail> there are a few caveats to that, given the gameplay loop
22:46:04 <Camail> but you gotta get there
22:55:11 <Dot`> did you end up just going bow every run?
22:55:22 <Runbunny> Oh!
22:55:51 <Camail> i won with a spear aspect and the secret sword aspect
22:56:00 <Dot`> also congrats
22:56:14 <Camail> have you seen all the normal additional aspects?
22:56:25 <Camail> cuz i found a good spear one i'd recommend if it isnt a spoiler
22:57:41 <Dot`> nope
22:57:53 <Camail> ok, well there's one that i dont actually hate
22:58:33 <Dot`> i really wanted to like the spear but the base one just doesnt seem great
22:58:52 <Camail> it is not, but there is a good one
23:26:47 <Runbunny> Sleep!
23:48:35 <Camail> holy shit
23:48:40 <Camail> pact hades broke my bow streak
23:48:44 <Camail> that fight is insane
23:48:54 <Camail> admittedly my build was actually kinda bad but still
