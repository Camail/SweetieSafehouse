21:42:54 <Runbunny> Most of it is alright, however making an encounter where you have to be inside a circle and just have the mobs you have to kill go outside the circle is pretty meh.
21:43:41 <Runbunny> Oh and they have a buff which gives them damage reduction and you have to run a specific element to that my to counter that buff.
21:43:50 <Runbunny> And he heals the other guys
21:44:06 <Runbunny> and you lose progress if you're outside the circle
21:44:08 <Runbunny> and it's timed.
