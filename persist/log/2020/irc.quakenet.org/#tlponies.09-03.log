23:18:05 <Camail> so i'm finally playing metro 2033 after owning it for years
23:18:16 <Dot|Phone> Great
23:18:33 <Camail> it scratches the itch
23:18:38 <Dot|Phone> Though has it aged well? 
23:18:44 <Camail> even on hardcore ranger it's not very punishing
23:18:51 <Camail> i'm palying the remaster
23:19:02 <Camail> and yea its holding up
23:19:14 <Dot|Phone> Oh. Didn't know they did one. It's a fun game
23:19:30 <Camail> i'm at a pretty boring part where the mechanic is to stare at a scary monsters for 15 seconds before they just...leave
23:19:50 <Camail> but other than that everything has been at least a 7/10, which is acceptable
23:19:52 <Dot|Phone> Talk to all the npc's. Nice lore bits
23:20:09 <Camail> with ranger its a bit tough to see whose an npc and whose just an idle model
23:20:26 <Camail> there's literally no ui so i miss a decent amount of that
23:20:30 <Dot|Phone> Yea, you just have to try on everyone
23:20:43 <Dot|Phone> I played ranger but it's been a while
23:20:47 <Camail> i listen to campfire dialogue
23:20:50 <Camail> before killing them all
