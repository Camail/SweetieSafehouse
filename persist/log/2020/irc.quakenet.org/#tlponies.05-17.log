08:20:24 <skrm> reifen, bj√∏rnen
08:25:28 <Dot`> its that skrm
08:29:21 <Dot`> i woke up this morning missing a sock
08:29:24 <Dot`> and i cant find it
08:32:59 <Dot`> is dub still playing terraria
08:37:58 <reification> sounds like he has an alibi for the missing sock then :p
08:39:40 <Dot`> I wouldnt count him out just yet
08:42:06 <skrm> did you dream about eating
08:42:10 <skrm> maybe you munched it
08:42:46 <Dot`> i dont have sock taste in my mouth
08:44:52 <Dot`> skrm, do you?
08:45:08 <skrm> dont think so
08:49:19 <reification> somehow i appear to have lived my life so far without learning the taste of socks
08:49:26 <reification> have i been missing out?
08:51:29 <Dot`> well, there is an easy way to find out
08:51:56 <Dot`> but rememeber socks are like cheese, many variaties, hand knitted wool are up there as one of the best
08:55:58 <skrm> i know what socks taste like but i have no memory of ever tasting one
08:56:32 <Dot`> proof skrm is a sleep sock eater
09:12:42 <reification> either that or he has very peculiar mystical powers
09:14:20 <reification> i have found a strange 'almost a country but not really' i want to visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transnistria

14:38:18 <carcinisation> having too much sanity must be a new problem for you :p

14:40:30 <carcinisation> what a useful image, especially for haachama fans
14:43:53 <Dot`> Dub, how is terrarara
14:44:07 <Runbunny> I think that Haato herself will have the most use for the image though.
14:44:13 <carcinisation> if you have reached the daytime drunken park ranting state already bun, i can see i shall have to visit to sort you out soon...
14:44:28 <Runbunny> :D
