12:09:47 <Dot`> :(
12:19:46 <Cane> Terry Goodkind died.
12:20:03 <Cane> I liked his books, then I hated his books, but he was an important figure in early modern fantasy.
12:37:16 <Golly> never read any of his stuff
12:37:22 <Golly> Goodkind was a proponent of Ayn Rand's philosophical approach of Objectivism,[6][7] and made references to Rand's ideas and novels in his works
12:37:34 <Golly> uh oh
12:38:11 <Golly> not a huge anti ayn rand person myself, but i can see how that could be an issue
12:39:13 <reification> yes i haven't read any of his stuff and that isn't the most promising
12:39:44 <reification> well i guess Mike Mentzer was fine
12:49:38 <reification> also tbf i have just started reading some of the gor books >.> so i can certainly overlook a touch of author filibustering

13:02:13 <Dot`> Hmm, i recognise the name Cane, but also have never read his stuff
13:02:54 <Cane> Yeah, Goodkind was a controversial figure who retained few readers as his books became more and more infused with his political ideology.
13:03:19 <Cane> He wrote the Sword of Truth series, one of the seminal early-day modern fantasy works. It starts off interestingly if a bit edgy, but the books get real bad as time goes on.
13:03:46 <Cane> The man himself was also abrasive to people online, which fueled people's dislike of him and his work.
13:03:49 <Cane> Controversial, as I said.
13:04:08 <Cane> But also hugely influential, at least for the first few books in the series.
13:04:52 <Cane> The first book featured interesting characters and BDSM sex, so you may be surprised to find it was hugely popular among younger fantasy readers.
13:05:03 <Dot`> ah, Sword of Truth. i tihnk ZK really liked those
13:05:15 <Dot`> and there was a tv series based on them
13:05:21 <Dot`> thats probably where i have heard it
13:05:35 <Cane> It went from being a decent and interesting if flawed series, and became one of the worst things I've read.
13:05:43 <Dot`> ouch
13:05:47 <Cane> Chainfire is my least favourite book I've ever read, and that's one of his.
13:06:31 <Cane> His main character Richard defeats Bill and Hillary Clinton by carving a pretty statue.
13:06:34 <Cane> That's not a joke.
13:06:42 <Dot`> HAHAHA
13:06:42 <Cane> It gets buttfuck retarded.
13:06:58 <Dot`> ive stopped reading a few series that got really bad but i cant compete with that
13:07:03 <Cane> NOBODY CAN
