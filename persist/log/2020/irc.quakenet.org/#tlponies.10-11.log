02:19:53 <Camail> cats are ok
03:52:22 <skrm> you're basically a human cat, cam
03:52:27 <skrm> i thought you'd like them more
03:52:42 <Camail> i prefer dogs, but cats are fine too
03:53:48 <skrm> what about crocodiles
03:55:17 <Camail> well, they are cool
03:55:21 <Camail> but dumb and lazy
03:55:27 <Camail> which is what got them so far
03:55:42 <Camail> similar to cats
03:55:58 <skrm> or sloths
03:56:18 <Camail> sloths are professional lamos
03:56:32 <skrm> lamos?
03:59:07 <Camail> lame-os
03:59:11 <skrm> oh lol
04:00:05 <skrm> I dont think most cats are dumb
04:00:09 <skrm> very lazy though
04:01:13 <skrm> i guess thats the priviledge of being the apex predator
