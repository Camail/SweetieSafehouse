22:21:04 <skrm> geoff 2: the geoffening
22:21:18 <Dot`> seems likely, hes enjoying the wednesday game im running
22:21:26 <Dot`> it woul dbe Geoff 3
22:21:38 <Dot`> as he is Geoff 2 in my current game
22:22:50 <Dot`> he discovered polearm fighters are a thing today, so i tihnk thats him sorted
22:24:43 <skrm> hahah
22:24:58 <skrm> geoff 3: return of the cowboy hat
22:31:02 <Dot`> what was your dorf called skram, i got bengelbert  but i dont tihnk thats it exactly
22:31:42 <DuB`> Minus one "b" :P
22:32:06 <Dot`> Ah, yes
22:32:15 <Dot`> bEngleert
22:32:17 <Bio> jenglebjoryt
22:33:58 <skrm> bjengelbjert
22:34:07 <skrm> its actually engelbert
22:34:14 <skrm> dont remember his last name
22:34:17 <skrm> or of that is his last name
22:34:33 <skrm> i just call him bjengelbort
22:34:37 <Dot`> wasnt Urist, so its not worth recalling
22:34:47 <skrm> fair point
22:34:49 <Bio> Unul Engelbert
22:35:00 <skrm> right
22:35:12 <skrm> i dont remember what unul means but i stole it from the DF dictionary
22:35:13 <Dot`> Urist Mc benglbert
22:35:44 <Dot`> Dank????
22:35:46 <skrm> oh yeah
22:35:47 <Dot`> really skram
22:35:48 <skrm> hahahah yes
22:35:53 <skrm> i remember 
22:35:59 <DuB`> lol!
22:36:08 <Dot`> haha your the worst
22:36:19 <skrm> pfffft
22:36:38 <skrm> all my dwarfs have names from the DF dictionary
22:37:21 <Dot`> using the DF disctionary is the correct thing to do, calling him Dank though
22:37:50 <skrm> its a perfectly respectable name for a mountain dwelling dorf
22:38:02 <Dot`> damp cave dorf
22:38:13 <Dot`> is he always soggy?
22:38:44 <skrm> ive not considered this yet, ill get back to you
22:39:05 <skrm> i dont recall if bjengleblert is the sober dwarf i made
22:39:13 <skrm> or if that was cleric mcpimphand
22:39:25 <Dot`> Vakist
22:39:28 <skrm> ya
22:39:48 <Dot`> Vakist means Lace?
22:39:55 <skrm> yes
22:40:51 <skrm> he was a gentle soul
22:40:53 <Dot`> so did you pick the dorf word , or pick an english word then look up what it was in dorfish
22:41:06 <Dot`> so gentle he slapped a dragon
22:41:48 <skrm> anger of a gentle man and all that
22:41:54 <skrm> i dont recall
22:42:17 <skrm> i think i just looked through the words to find some that could work as a name and then pick the one that means something neat
