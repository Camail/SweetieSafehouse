00:28:08 <BioSC> tired
00:29:08 <Runbunny> Same.
00:29:15 <Runbunny> But work must be done.
00:30:32 <BioSC> asdf
00:34:51 <skram> Its a hard job, but someones gotta see every pekora lewd, Runbunny
00:35:02 <skram> glad you're out there doing a difference
00:35:26 <Runbunny> I'm glad to be of service peko.
00:49:36 <DuB`> Kana Sukoya is so preeeetty but time budget allows for hololive or nijisanji, surely not both...
00:50:17 <skram> both is fine
00:50:26 <skram> surely you dont need to sleep EVERY night??
00:51:45 <DuB`> hm hmm
00:51:57 <reification> tonight i will sleep
00:52:02 <reification> right now in fact
00:52:15 <DuB`> zzz
00:53:21 <skram> or
00:53:24 <skram> get another monitor
00:53:37 <DuB`> I HAVE been looking into that :P
00:53:43 <DuB`> That and chair are my last setup upgrades
00:54:12 <skram> I need to knock down some walls before i can get a 3rd monitor :p
00:54:47 <DuB`> I got a third monitor arm without realizing that my old 1080p 60hz I haven't been using doesn't actually have VESA mount...
00:55:07 <DuB`> So I just use that monitor with my work laptop now
00:55:20 <DuB`> And now I need a REAL third monitor to use with the arm!
00:56:53 <skram> need more desk
00:56:58 <skram> what size are your monitors?
00:57:11 <DuB`> Think they're all 24
00:57:33 <DuB`> I sit with my nose right in them so I haven't felt a need for 27 inch or more
01:09:34 <Runbunny> I guess I'll go sleep.
01:09:40 <Runbunny> Goodnight friends.
01:09:48 <DuB`> zZz

05:34:00 <Dot`> Dub
05:35:17 <skram> I think he fell asleep, Dot`
05:35:26 <Dot`> why havnt you though skram
05:35:29 <Dot`> its too early
05:35:52 <skram> My free time is ending rapidly and im gonna make the most of it by not going to bed
05:36:01 <skram> instead im gonna pass out in the morning and sleep for 16 hours
05:36:22 <Dot`> very useful
05:36:23 <skram> also i need to get purple science going
05:36:31 <Dot`> but it makes me sad becuase you sleep while im awake
05:36:47 <skram> but first i need to get the oil railroad going
05:36:55 <skram> buit before that i should probably get nuclear power up and running
05:36:56 <skram> aaaa
05:37:00 <skram> factorio is dumb
05:37:21 <Dot`> lol
05:39:23 <Dot`> yes, want to do x, but first i need y and z, and for those i need to sort out w and then you relalise you will need more of 3 other things before you even think about that
05:39:47 <Dot`> then 3 days later you see you still need x
05:39:55 <skram> pretty much
05:40:18 <skram> at least i got 4 saturated iron belts
05:40:29 <skram> if i ever get to the point where thats not enough im probably just gonna quit lol
05:45:51 <Dot`> well next step is either trains or drones to get it around
05:47:12 <skram> drones are too slow
05:47:19 <skram> trains go so fsat
05:48:27 <Dot`> drones once upgraded use to be the only way to go, they way outperformed belts
05:48:43 <Dot`> but i know they did some tweaking to that, not sure where it ended up though
05:49:43 <skram> half the fun is trying to weave that one belt through 9000 other belts
05:51:02 <Dot`> i agree, belts are so much more fun, but effeiciency!
05:51:32 <skram> if I was too worried about efficiency there are probably 420 other things i should fix first
06:00:37 <DuB`> Whoops sleeptimes
