15:12:28 <DuB`> Sleep is nonsense
15:12:35 <Dot|Phone> Indeed
15:12:47 <DuB`> I go to bed at 11:30 or midnight on weekdays to wake up around 8 for work and feel like garbage
15:13:09 <DuB`> Go to bed at 3am on friday night and wake up naturally at 8am still despite setting 10:30am alarm, and feel fantastic and go for a run
15:13:18 <Dot|Phone> Maybe you get too much sleep on weekdays
15:13:37 <Dot|Phone> If I get 9 hours or more sleep I feel awful
15:15:21 <Dot|Phone> Did you manage to run without any blood coming out? 
15:16:43 <DuB`> Seems so

15:33:00 <DuB`> Think I decided on sentinel
15:33:03 <DuB`> Haven't done hp up
15:33:06 <Runbunny> DuB`, 
15:33:33 <Runbunny> Do I just farm guilding lands till I have the stuff I want? !??!
15:35:26 <DuB`> Basically
15:35:46 <DuB`> All the different augments will take different monster mats from there
15:36:54 <DuB`> Bring 1 level of Geologist, doubles the shiny pickups which are the main source of the mats
15:39:23 <Runbunny> O:
15:39:25 <Runbunny> Smart!
15:39:56 <skrm> Anders. Jake.
15:41:43 <Runbunny> Jonas.
15:43:54 <DuB`> Farming GL is pretty chill. Deaths don't matter at all, which also makes a level of Fortify very strong
15:44:02 <DuB`> Get that +20% atk and 30% def
15:44:04 <DuB`> skrm!
