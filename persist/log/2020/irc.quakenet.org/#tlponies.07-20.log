20:31:05 <Dot`> hmm, i would like you to be doing great pls
20:32:54 <Camail> yea, getting there
20:33:06 <Dot`> thanks <3
20:33:07 <Camail> always something new to be introspective about, but i'm getting there
20:33:34 <Camail> trying monster train, makes me appreciate how much better griftlands is
20:34:19 <Dot`> havnt heard of it
20:35:06 <Dot`> its rated super well on steam
20:35:38 <Camail> its ok
20:35:59 <Dot`> but im biased to griftlands, i like Klei and I like th eart style they chose for griftlands
20:37:23 <Dot`> you done a few more runs in griftlands?
20:43:32 <Camail> i did a few more on the first character, havent done the second yet
20:43:43 <Camail> the story is fun and i wanna be in the right mood for a anrrative
20:43:55 <Dot`> hmm, yea, i get that
20:44:02 <Dot`> did the later runs become more tricky?
20:44:29 <Camail> not especially so, the difficulty curve on the first few are aren't super noticeable 
20:44:47 <Camail> and then i got bored
20:49:53 <Dot`> thats a shame, though i would put you higher level skill than the average player
21:05:16 <Camail> it takes a lot to get me to play a game like this for a sustained period
21:05:27 <Camail> slay the spire was so good it is practically genre defining
21:36:34 <Dot`> oh. day9 has played monster train, guess ill watch a bit of that
