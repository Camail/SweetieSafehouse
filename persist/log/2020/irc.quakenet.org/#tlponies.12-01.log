00:46:12 <DuB`> I've decided to get rid of my steering wheel controller... I plugged it in last night for the first time in a while to try out Forza and immediately got loud popping noises and a shower of big sparks
00:46:31 <reification> that is not good
00:48:13 <reification> hob is past owl, time to sleep and leave dot in charge
00:48:17 <reification> night all

14:50:42 <Cane> So I've added support for multiple colored lights into my lighting engine. What it does is it adds all lights to a list, iterates through it, and then discards the information and crashes to desktop.

22:29:02 <Dot`> skram
22:29:11 <skram> aye pal
22:29:16 <Dot`> hi
22:29:21 <Dot`> how was your busy day?
22:30:01 <skram> pretty good, got some baking done
22:30:38 <skram> went out to put up some christmas lights, got it tangled in an indecipherable mess and decided to not bother
22:30:52 <skram> how was werk
22:32:03 <Dot`> just doing the final parts on the SCADA/LOI before handing it over to the other guy for testing his code
22:32:44 <Dot`> mayeb do some inter PLC comms adnd some telemtry if u get time
22:33:30 <skram> multiple plcs? how decadent
22:34:59 <Dot`> its on Hull, second largest site i believe in england
22:35:11 <Dot`> ours is PLC number 38
22:35:22 <Runbunny> I'm gonna go sleep.
22:35:24 <Runbunny> Goodnight.
22:35:26 <skram> how much memory could you possible need
22:35:27 <Dot`> according to IP addreses at least, but i guess thay doesnt account for the modbus network
22:35:28 <skram> gnight ranban
22:35:32 <Dot`> gnight bun
22:35:48 <Dot`> memory?
22:36:14 <skram> for programs
22:36:42 <Dot`> its not that, its diffrent sections
22:36:51 <skram> i dont know the technical IO limits for modern plcs, but in older-ish units the limit was usually memory
22:37:24 <Dot`> dronfield was 6 12 slot racks 
22:37:50 <Dot`> and we didnt need the largest PLC memory
22:38:04 <skram> thats a lot
22:38:27 <Dot`> water isnt very complex so memory isnt often an issue
22:39:21 <skram> nothing is very complex when you put it like that, dot :p
22:39:49 <Dot`> i mean water control systems, haha
22:40:19 <reification> you wouldn't want to get the wrong amount of Hs with your Os
22:42:30 <skram> if you just put some extra Hs in there you can make your own reactor!
22:42:48 <skram> lots of processes involved with water treatment though Dot`
22:42:52 <skram> that need their own sub routine
22:43:12 <skram> and at least 50% of it is magi
22:43:13 <skram> c
22:44:29 <Dot`> there are some complex ones i guess, like the weird one with liquid nitrogen. but for the most part its monitoring, opening valves and running pumps
22:49:13 <skram> have you ever run into electrodianization?
22:49:31 <Dot`> is that for clean water?
22:49:40 <skram> we got a machine that does that at work and i dont understand how it works
22:50:05 <skram> its a polishing filter, after the reverse osmosis part
22:50:20 <Dot`> see, thats fancy power generating stuff
22:50:33 <Dot`> thats why power is big money
22:50:40 <Dot`> its complex
22:50:50 <skram> something like .12 uS/cm conductivity on the outlet
22:51:41 <skram> its not that complex, you just boil some water and then ask it to do mechanical work
22:52:09 <Dot`> easy
23:18:29 <reification> night all
23:18:34 <skram> gnight reifen
23:18:46 <Dot`> gnight reif
