22:00:48 <Runbunny> Well Henrik. Today was mostly good things.
22:01:18 <Runbunny> I did a ton of manual labor and cut down some trees. So workout is done.
22:01:21 <Runbunny> However
22:02:46 <Runbunny> Yesterday my fathers car was stolen by a guy who escaped from the psychiatric ward with a fire extinguisher. 
22:03:29 <reification> ...
22:04:32 <Dot`> denmark sounds wild
22:04:59 <reification> lets stay safely away 
22:05:22 <Runbunny> Dude it's so crazy.
22:05:36 <reification> i assume they got it back if you know that info?
22:06:00 <Runbunny> What he actually did with the car was he drove to his parents house and burned it down.
22:06:39 <Dot`> was anyone hurt during his escapades?
22:06:51 <Runbunny> Car is mostly unscaved, but is kinda ruined by the smoke.
22:07:41 <Runbunny> I don't think so.
22:07:50 <Golly> are there newspaper articles about this?
22:07:56 <Runbunny> yeah
22:08:01 <Runbunny> Mostly in danish.
22:08:37 <Runbunny> None of them mention that he was escaped from the psychiatric ward though.
22:09:26 <Runbunny> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aINnO3iU9Dg
22:09:36 <Runbunny> Kinda video of the fire.

22:16:45 <Runbunny> It sure is. I am going to be completely destroyed tomorrow.
22:17:00 <Dot`> i appreciate he stole the car weilding a fire extinguisher, to go start a fire
22:17:04 <Runbunny> Since using muscles is hard and all that.
22:17:15 <Runbunny> There is some irony there.
