09:31:53 <Dot|Phone> What is your job? Who will you be working for
09:32:15 <Rawr|Fone> Developer for a company called Atea
09:33:07 <Dot|Phone> They are a fair size
09:35:00 <Rawr|Fone> The team of developers is very small though
09:35:30 <Dot|Phone> That's good

09:38:59 <Dot|Phone> Sounds great 
09:39:10 <Dot|Phone> Is it far travel?

09:42:19 <Dot|Phone> What's the dress code?

09:48:25 <Dot|Phone> Nope. There where ppl in shorts and t-shirt interviewing me. 
09:49:28 <Dot|Phone> But some places who do the same work as us have to wear a tie and everything
09:49:37 <Dot|Phone> Sounds awful
09:50:04 <Rawr|Fone> I think it was like that here 15 years ago
