00:12:07 <DuB`> Now my pc will have little more than chrome, mirc, spotify, and monhun on it :P
00:12:39 <Camail> did your ssd die?
00:13:03 <Camail> or are you whittling it down to just your addictions
00:13:05 <DuB`> The old one ye
00:13:49 <DuB`> Old 240gb ssd died 'n took windows with if, just got everything reinstalled on the new 2tb ssd I got a couple months ago
00:14:07 <DuB`> And have the old old 1tb hdd for... ignoring now, mostly
00:14:19 <Camail> thats the porn drive
00:14:24 <Camail> the D: stands for dick
00:14:49 <DuB`> Send your 1tb of futa on over, then
00:14:49 <Cane> Does it? I've been doing it all wrong, that's my drive for games. God, I'm such a scrub.
00:15:28 <Camail> futa is so 2008
00:15:50 <Runbunny> Indeed.
00:16:09 <Camail> oh wow, relevant to that topic i didnt realize bible black came out in 2000
00:16:13 <Camail> jesus christ, what is time
00:16:16 <Camail> and why is it so fast
00:16:18 <Camail> make it stop
00:16:35 <DuB`> nyoom
00:16:57 <Camail> god, imagine what people in 2000 thought of that
00:17:12 <Camail> at that point it must've been the utter DEPTHS of depravity
00:17:26 <Camail> but ok maybe this conversation is a bit fucked so that's all i'm gonna say
00:17:33 <Runbunny> Somerthing like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-JqQoWH8-o
00:18:08 <Runbunny> The dub makes it even better.
00:18:25 <Camail> oh my god i cant handle old school dubs
00:20:11 <Camail> i used to watch brett at around this time
00:20:17 <Camail> i think thats his shitty apartment in japan
00:20:24 <Camail> he's been back in cali for years now
00:21:05 <Runbunny> Yeah, that video is super old.

01:53:42 <Camail> man, you can see exactly when the BNHA guys ran out of money/time for an episode
01:53:52 <Camail> what a bummer
01:55:03 <Camail> oh no, its was just time
01:55:18 <Camail> to the point where the intro to the next episode is what they wanted to end the last episode on
01:56:03 <Camail> the show's pacing is so good that its easy to see where they wanted to end it, but they just had key frames done and had to ship it
02:44:25 <Camail> ok, up to date on bnha
02:44:28 <Camail> good show
02:44:30 <Camail> good good
02:44:36 <Camail> very hype, approved.
