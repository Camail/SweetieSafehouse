19:52:28 <Camail> yo
19:59:15 <Dot`> yo
20:03:49 <Camail> oy
20:03:55 <Camail> so is tarted playing bannerlord
20:04:11 <Camail> i got bored of the first game, i could conquor everything but sieging suuuuuuuuucks
20:04:44 <Cane> I love the first game but yes, it has issues, specifically sieging.
20:04:46 <Camail> i havent done much in bannerlord but i know the siege mechanics are actually... extant 
20:05:17 <Camail> so far bannerlord is basically a better version of the first game, its just incomplete
20:05:40 <Camail> it kinda holds your hand with commerce tho, unless thats just my trade skill doing it
20:05:50 <Cane> How does it hold your hand?
20:09:36 <Camail> when you hover over an item to buy, it'll show nearby towns that either sell it cheaper or will buy it for more
20:09:47 <Camail> so it does your local commerce research for you
20:10:13 <Camail> it doesnt do anything for to towns REALLY far away, as far as i can tell
20:10:53 <Camail> i've made like 15k just from that with very little effort, which is pretty big for early game
20:22:42 -!- Rawr|Fone [~AndChat52@c-94cfe455.020-164-6d6c6d4.bbcust.telenor.se] has joined #tlponies
20:23:08 <Rawr|Fone> I think that comes with trading skill cam
20:23:36 <Rawr|Fone> At least I think there was something similar in the other games
20:24:28 <Camail> the other game had the option to spend a day searching for info, yea, but its waaaaaay more comprehensive in this game
20:24:50 <Camail> also bannerlord still has a lot of those features, asking townspeople for info, talking to caravans
20:25:09 <Camail> but now you can see the price for every single tradeable commodity, in exacting detail
20:25:38 <Camail> there's like, no game to be played there, as a merchant
20:35:52 <Rawr|Fone> Hmm
20:42:50 <Bio> asdf
20:43:01 <Bio> i shall end the work for today

22:45:25 <Camail> yea, i enjoy it
22:45:37 <Camail> i went with realistic from the get go, so the start was REAL rough
22:46:07 <Camail> and i'm not very far, still only have ~40 troops, and chasing bandits around to level up my guys

23:11:12 <Camail> skram is the saddest barbarian
23:11:24 <Camail> oooh
23:11:33 <Camail> new subclass, depression barb
23:11:46 <Camail> you take less damage because you just dont give a fuck
23:12:57 <Dot`> haha
23:12:58 <Camail> you dont get any of the speed bonus
23:13:01 <Camail> you might even go slower
23:13:20 <Dot`> but you also slow down others by being so deppressing to be around?
23:13:54 <Camail> barbs typically dont have external stuff tho, right, other than intimidating shout or w/e
23:14:05 <Camail> you can have vacant stare
23:14:12 <Dot`> changed a bit with xanathar
23:14:19 <Dot`> those subclases have a few
23:15:06 <Camail> people cant insight check because you are so monotone and your face is lifeless
23:15:37 <Camail> you dont take exhaustion from staying up, but you always have one point
23:16:11 <Dot`> gain exaustion from social encounters
23:16:14 <Camail> but yea, can't be charmed because that requires the caster to be able to imprint their desires on you
23:16:27 <Camail> thats introversion not depression dot
23:16:33 <Camail> some depressed people actually enjoy others :P
23:16:43 <Dot`> i doubt that
23:16:47 <Camail> haha
23:18:07 <Camail> disadvantage on charisma skill checks
23:18:34 <Camail> basically, a social wall and a mental wall, so the depression barb cant affect others but gain resistances in the other direction
23:19:04 <Camail> those mechanics already kind of have a home in the barb so it makes sense
23:20:15 <Dot`> "i would like to ra.. be sad"
23:20:37 <Camail> as they melt into the floor
23:20:49 <Camail> we should email this to liam
23:20:51 <Camail> he's be all over it
23:20:54 <Camail> he'd*
23:22:35 <Camail> hm....its the ultimate tank class
23:22:56 <Camail> you could have a pathetic aura about you, that taunts enemies into trying to kill you as an easy target
23:25:43 <Dot`> get prof in stealth as ppl just really dont want to notice you exist
23:26:42 <skram> hmm
23:27:04 <skram> what would drepression barbs even do
23:27:08 <skram> whats the point of attacking
23:27:32 <skram> maybe it would be the first true tank class
23:28:14 <skram> with a special aggro skill because baddies want to kick the sad depressed horse
23:29:45 <Bio> hej
23:29:49 <Bio> new run starting now
23:29:52 <skram> bio, the Boi
23:29:58 <Bio> tis i
23:34:20 <Camail> skram i was thinking about that, and I think its more that depression would enhance your combat, much like how rage does. Barbarian players still get to choose how they fight, despite the blind rage, they still can make any tactical or intelligent choice they want
23:35:08 <Camail> so you can be depressed and still do normal combat things, just like any other barb, so the core mechanics just get a bit of flavor but nothing else
23:35:29 <Camail> there are plenty of functional depressed people
23:35:38 <skram> fair enough
23:36:17 <skram> but a bonus damage modifier wouldnt make much sense i think
23:36:24 <Camail> true, and you aren't raging
23:36:29 <Camail> so you wouldnt get a rage damage bonus
23:37:15 <Camail> take away the benefits of aggression, replace them with benefits of depression, and keep the core player character gameplay

23:38:01 <Camail> hell, you dont even need to play as a sadboi, people have sudden bouts of depression all the time
23:38:12 <Camail> its even more interesting if you play the opposite
23:38:41 <skram> or a bipolar barb character
23:38:45 <Camail> like the fairytale princess ripping someone's spine out, the cheerful go-getter turning into a sad ball of sludge
23:38:58 <skram> manic mode is regular barb and sad mode is depression barb
23:39:19 <Camail> thats gotta be at like, lvl 10
23:40:17 <Camail> bi-polar is tricky because i've never known anyone with it
23:41:02 <skram> ive got a bipolar 2nd cousin
23:41:39 <Camail> bi-polar can also be really different for a lot of people
23:41:59 <Camail> its just one of those mental illnesses that's a bit too ephemeral for me to do anything with
23:42:08 <skram> thats probably true for most mental illnesses
23:42:16 <Camail> yea
23:42:40 <Camail> but bi-polar is kinda inherantly complex tho, ya?
23:42:46 <Camail> being two competing emotive states
23:43:03 <skram> for her its "normal" with bouts of massive self destructive and sometimes illegal behaviour really
23:43:21 <Camail> yea, a lot of people might only ever experience the manic side
23:43:30 <skram> dont know her real well but its fuckin difficult for everyone
23:43:44 <skram> herself most of all
23:43:52 <Camail> its hard when the illness makes you not want to take meds FOR the illness
23:44:28 <skram> yeah no kidding
23:45:20 <skram> not to mention that long-time use of some of those meds are just straight up harming
