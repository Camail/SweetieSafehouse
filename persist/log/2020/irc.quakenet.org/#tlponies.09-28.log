09:49:32 <Micen> hi reif
09:49:49 <reification> hello micen
09:50:08 <reification> is it not rather early or late where you are?
09:51:00 <reification> .tell runbunny https://i.redd.it/yxv2orqlgsp51.png
09:51:13 <Micen> early, woke up about an hour ago
09:51:30 <Micen> just going on 6am here
09:51:56 <reification> impressive
09:52:19 <reification> i was woken this morning by building work i had been told was delayed
09:52:25 <reification> it was confusing
09:55:53 <Dot`> hey reif
09:56:03 <reification> hi dotties
09:56:05 <Dot`> .roll d20 for more coffee
10:01:29 <Cane> Picked up Factorio. Already making neat designs. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/112498538897776640/760078480725245972/unknown.png
10:01:31 <Cane> I may be in trouble.
10:01:53 <reification> have you angered the natives?
10:02:28 <Cane> You may notice I have researched stone walls. This is because there are several monster spawners right next to the various ore fields.
10:02:35 <Cane> I got gnawed on.
10:03:33 <Cane> So far the game's very easy, though. The difficulty lies in creating conveyor belt supply lines more than alien infestations.
10:03:57 <Dot`> you got to get RSO and also crank up the number of biters
10:04:18 <Dot`> then your forced to head out far to get resources from pretty early on
10:06:12 <Dot`> i do enjoy a good conveyer system going all th eway aroud the base supplying ammo to mass amounts of turrets
