16:09:02 <Dot`> i got free cheese today from the Bakewell Cheese Shop
16:09:55 <skram> :O
16:09:57 <skram> lucky!
16:11:29 <Dot`> when you going to visit
16:11:30 <reify> only because they contaminated it with lime and chilli *p
16:11:57 <Dot`> its great cheese
16:12:18 <Dot`> they have shelves of gins and other alcahol liquid substances skram 
16:12:36 <reify> those are fine things dot but they do not belong together
16:13:02 <Dot`> reif, i should send you some to prove you wrong
16:13:07 <Dot`> is that your ploy all along?
16:13:15 <skram> Gin and cheese seems like an odd combo as well
16:13:39 <Dot`> well they also have duck eggs, if that helps
16:13:55 <skram> Not really
16:14:07 <reify> i have already been mailed much fancy food in the last fortnight
16:14:12 <reify> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ElApLMdWkAE3VIg?format=jpg&name=medium
16:15:28 <skram> both of you are spoiled
16:15:40 <Dot`> i dont know what they could sell then that would make you happy skram
16:16:17 <skram> Hmmm
16:16:19 <skram> Pizza?
16:16:34 <reify> i should do food shopping now
16:20:11 <Dot`> you should make your own pizza from scratch
16:20:34 <skram> thats too much work sometimes
16:21:18 <Runbunny> Jonas.
16:21:25 <skram> Anders
16:21:27 <Runbunny> Where is your free cheese?
16:22:16 <skram> No free cheese for poor old skrammen :(
16:22:46 <Dot`> well if your all so negative about lime and chillie cheese there can be no free cheese
16:23:27 <Runbunny> Sad day :(
16:24:36 <Dot`> indeed. such cheese hate
16:27:19 <reify> lies. ‚Äôtis not hate to wish a lovely thing go undespoiled!
16:27:30 <reify> i shall go and get my own cheese now
16:35:46 <BioPhone> I got a free pza from the pza place cus it took them an hour to send me last fridays pza
16:35:53 <BioPhone> Ezpz
