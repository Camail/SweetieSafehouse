17:16:37 <Camail> all the lab zero staff remade a different studio
17:16:48 <Camail> i hope autumn games contracts them to skullgirls
17:16:54 <Camail> that would be hilarious
17:28:52 <skram> what happened to lab zero?
17:29:52 <Dot`> ppl
17:30:34 <skram> ah
17:30:40 <skram> the worst kind
17:51:17 <Rawr|Fone> Hmm
17:54:42 <Camail> its very complicated
17:55:00 <Camail> but the simplest answer is that the owner was a piece of shit and everyone abandoned him
17:55:18 <Camail> you cant fire the owner but you can leave and make a company without them

18:01:26 <Camail> yea, it's interesting
18:01:43 <Camail> the leads left, the company lost its contracts, and then everyone else was fired
18:02:02 <Camail> so it was more organic then planned

23:21:18 <BioSC> i been fiddling around with wow again 2 skrm
23:21:26 <BioSC> its v sad not having my guild on
23:21:44 <BioSC> we died early on in bfa
23:21:56 <skram> ye :(
23:22:36 <BioSC> we do other stuff, but i'm purty sure they wont come back fully unless its just a blowout xpac
23:22:41 <skram> i've made a new char that im gonna main in shadowlands so ive just been spending a lil time getting them ready
23:23:28 <BioSC> yeh
23:23:50 <skram> we've been doing like local area guild for a few years and they always implode because there's a lot of shitters
23:24:00 <skram> like 50 wipes on imperator normal kind of shitters
23:24:11 <BioSC> my mage is ready ish, he's got ilvl 440 or so, and i've been leveling a druid to maybe mess around with healing or tanking
23:25:19 <BioSC> im trying to remember what imperator is
23:25:56 <skram> its the last boss in highmaul
23:25:57 <skram> WoD
23:26:00 <BioSC> Imperator Mar'gok from Highmaul
23:26:02 <BioSC> yeah
23:26:10 <BioSC> we fuckin struggled on that boss heroic
23:27:09 <skram> its not a hard fight, mechanics-wise, but if your fuckin friends dont dodge the the things you make your healers life very hard
23:27:12 <BioSC> i think mythic we only got to butcher too
23:27:25 <BioSC> we are very good at standing in fire
23:27:38 <BioSC> so much so, that our RL at the time in Legion
23:27:45 <skram> friggin deeps
23:27:46 <BioSC> for that green and purple boss
23:27:55 <BioSC> in Hellfire
23:28:03 <skram> ah i didnt do any legion stuff
23:28:13 <BioSC> made us install an addon that /yelled "I'm standing in Immolation"
23:28:17 <BioSC> if we were standing in fire
23:28:27 <skram> kinkshamed
23:28:36 <BioSC> and i still have a macro on my bars to this day that spams just that
23:29:11 <BioSC> as well as an Amplify Magic /yell "I'm casting Amp Magic, Healers!!!"
23:29:14 <BioSC> macro
23:29:28 <skram> advanced
23:29:49 <BioSC> they gotta know that they get that dank +10% healing
23:30:49 <skram> im doing demonology lock
23:31:02 <skram> my numbers are shit but when it all comes together i got like 20 friends at the same time
23:31:06 <skram> its really good
23:31:41 <BioSC> you all raiding normal then?
23:31:56 <skram> ah no

23:32:21 <BioSC> thats a good milkshake then
23:32:29 <skram> bb u kno it
23:34:02 <skram> im probably gonna spend time pushing mythics instead
23:34:10 <skram> i find it a lot more fun than raiding now anyway
23:34:27 <BioSC> nice
23:34:39 <BioSC> we'll see what happens
23:34:53 <BioSC> i'll probably post about it on my guild's discord, see who's coming back
23:35:10 <BioSC> main goal i think before pre-patch is to get a max cape i think
23:35:41 <skram> ye i guess
23:35:50 <skram> visions are so boring though
23:36:16 <BioSC> you aren't wrong
23:37:04 <BioSC> i do like the legendaries tho
23:37:45 <BioSC> i did wanna get the longboi
23:37:57 <BioSC> but ya boi aint got the time to farm up like 3.8mil gold
23:38:05 <skram> thats a big noperino, pal
23:38:43 <BioSC> but he's a big fuckoff dinosaur skorm
23:38:53 <BioSC> want
23:39:30 <skram> mount grinding is so passé
23:39:55 <skram> i already have the best mount, spider notwithstanding
23:41:03 <BioSC> TLPD??
23:41:15 <skram> what?
23:41:19 <skram> no, mimirons head

23:41:47 <BioSC> lol nice, mine is from the same xpac tho, Time-Lost Proto Drake
23:41:51 <skram> it goes fap fap fap fap sproink fap fap fap
23:42:09 <BioSC> thats one boss mount i don't have yet
23:42:16 <skram> yeah the rare spawn
23:42:22 <skram> never had the patience to camp it
23:42:34 <BioSC> i was a persistent lad
23:42:42 <BioSC> i did it twice
23:42:47 <skram> jeez
23:42:48 <BioSC> once for my bro, and once for me
23:43:08 <BioSC> my char was on a pvp server at the time
23:43:11 <skram> i got the blue proto drake from utgard though
23:43:12 <BioSC> so the camp suuuucked
23:43:20 <BioSC> but i found a good strat
23:43:27 <skram> only noobs play on rp servers bio, pls
23:43:37 <BioSC> pvp sir
23:43:59 <BioSC> (h*ck the alliance)
23:44:15 <skram> death to the horde
23:44:28 <skram> did you see what they did to my jaina??
23:44:44 <BioSC> what i did was i flew up real high right on one of his spawn points, dismounted, and had a macro that would revive me, target tlpd, and shoot icelance at it to tag it
23:44:57 <BioSC> then when my rarespawn addon went off, spammed the shit out of that macro
23:45:32 <skram> thats some shady tactics bio
23:45:34 <skram> i like it
23:45:56 <BioSC> i mean, some shitty rouge camped the fuck outta me a couple days in a row
23:46:03 <BioSC> and i was like, well, now IM invisible
23:47:24 <BioSC> when i finally killed it, it actually fell on the side of the mountain
23:47:28 <BioSC> and I couldn't loot it
23:47:41 <BioSC> had to put in a GM ticket
23:47:51 <skram> aww
23:48:05 <skram> nowadays you'd just get it in the post though
23:48:19 <BioSC> yeah for sure, I didn't risk it though
23:48:41 <BioSC> i wonder if i lost that screenshot
23:49:19 <BioSC> proll
23:55:18 <BioSC> i'd like to try and get in on a heroic raid, but i know i'd prolly get rejected every time
23:55:22 <skram> man i had screenshots all the way from vanilla up to cata and i lost most of them
23:55:59 <BioSC> yeah, thinking back, they were probably on my old hard drive that got fucked
23:58:34 <skram> https://i.imgur.com/sCQzpsd.jpg
23:58:46 <skram> from my guilds very first naxx kill, i even got the t3 boots
