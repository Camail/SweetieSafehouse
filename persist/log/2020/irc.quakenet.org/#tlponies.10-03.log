00:00:20 <Dot`> did you win?
00:00:33 <Runbunny> Bed time for me.
00:00:42 <Runbunny> Sounds like a fun time Camail.
00:02:23 <Camail> i did win, to some degree
00:02:39 <Camail> i am not rich, but i dont think i care about that anymore
00:21:30 <Dot`> rawr
00:21:39 <Camail> ok so
00:21:42 <Camail> i am richer
00:21:51 <Camail> but i am still not rich
00:22:03 <Camail> but dropping a 9ex item feels good
00:22:21 <Dot`> so rich
00:28:49 <DuB`> Hm
00:28:54 <DuB`> I think I haven't had breakfast yet
00:29:02 <DuB`> But I'm not even a little hungry
00:29:07 <DuB`> Body pls
00:29:44 <Camail> dub are you in japan
00:29:55 <Camail> because breakfast is not the right word to use at 8:30
00:30:18 <DuB`> Right
00:35:24 <Dot`> breakfast is the first meal of the day
00:35:32 <Dot`> unless its brunch
00:46:03 <skram> breakfast is the first meal of the day regardless of the time
00:47:22 <Raelcun> I disagree, it's only breakfast if you eat 3 meals
00:47:28 <Raelcun> my first meal of the day is often lunch
00:47:42 <skram> hmm
00:47:53 <skram> what if you only have 2
00:48:06 <Raelcun> that's why my first meal is lunch
00:50:00 <Dot`> does really strong coffee count?
00:50:45 <DuB`> I usually have a glass of water for breakfast
00:50:47 <DuB`> v refreshe
00:51:56 <Dot`> dub you should be drinking water all day
00:52:02 <DuB`> I do! Lots!
00:52:29 <Dot`> by you definition then you eat breakfast all day
00:52:36 <skram> coffee is like 95% water anyway
00:53:07 <Dot`> as are you skram
00:53:43 <skram> well not quite
00:54:02 <skram> im at least 20% spite
