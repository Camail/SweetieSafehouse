14:53:03 <Dot|Phone> It's home time bio. So good
14:56:08 <Runbunny> Dot|Phone, I have caught a cold.
14:56:18 <Runbunny> So misery is everything right now
14:56:28 <Dot|Phone> Aww 
14:57:09 <Dot|Phone> But important question. Have you recently bought anything that says " made on China". On it
15:00:24 <Runbunny> Nope, also this is just a cold. No pneumonia or anything
15:11:36 <Dot|Phone> Great
15:13:24 <Rawr|Phone> Not yet
15:13:26 <BioPone> No bleeding from the face?
15:15:44 <Dot|Phone> Like dub after exercise 
15:17:43 <Runbunny> No bleeding from face.
15:18:34 <Runbunny> However, there is a steady flow of vicous liquid from nostrils.

15:30:18 <carcinisation> "We also noticed that the only Asian donor (male) has a much higher ACE2-expressing cell ratio than white and African American donors (2.50% vs. 0.47% of all cells). This might explain the observation that the new Coronavirus pandemic and previous SARS-Cov pandemic are concentrated in the Asian area."
15:32:30 <Runbunny> Yeah.
15:32:31 <Runbunny> Neat.
