00:16:26 <Rial> There I go, on the left :3c 
00:18:30 <reification> neat concept
00:19:15 <skram> what an absolute unit
00:24:59 <Rial> yay! thanks
00:25:12 <Rial> I'm doing my best to spread the word. We kinda want to fill the whoole frame
00:32:30 <Zounds> dem floofy ears
00:32:56 <Rial> floof
00:33:10 <Rial> Meanwhile I've been studying background painting, in secret
00:39:46 <skram> how long have you been drawing stuff rial
00:40:47 <Rial> Hmm, that's a good question, because I don't really have a concrete answer. If you count drawing something once a year, I've been doing it since I was 14 -- but 1 drawing a year doens't count, in my opinion
00:42:01 <Rial> Consistently, been drawing for less than as year, that's for sure. At least once every month. Things really picked up for me in December 2019... so uhhh, 2 months ago
00:42:26 <skram> dang thats pretty good
00:42:56 <Rial> Thanks! I'm doing my best
00:43:28 <Rial> My goal at the moment is to get really good at painting
00:44:14 <Rial> I want to do stuff like this wonderful piece: https://i.imgur.com/YkTctLX.jpg
00:45:59 <skram> thats a big goal
00:46:33 <Rial> I know right?! 	It's awesome. Thinking baout it makes me pumped up
00:46:47 <skram> i used to do watercolours but i wasnt immediately amazing at it so i quit
00:46:51 <skram> i have no discipline :p
00:47:19 <Rial> I see! Sounds like me when I tried to learn C++
00:49:05 <Rial> quick painting example from one of my fav artists https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZLHi4iW8rM
