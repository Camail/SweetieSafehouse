18:00:00 <Runbunny> Good shark.
18:08:53 <skram> Good shark.
18:10:01 <DoT`> i think you all live in countries without sharks
18:10:54 <skram> plenty of sharks in the north sea, DoT`
18:11:02 <skram> none of them talk, however
18:14:49 <DuB`> Ya I think gura shark is the only species that livestreams
18:16:21 <skram> well theres the alien kettle shark and the shitposting shark
18:16:24 <skram> they too livestream
18:16:49 <DuB`> hm hmm
19:20:30 <Golly> have any of you guys played grim dawn?
19:21:50 <DoT`> yes and i tihnk Runbunny 
19:21:58 <Runbunny> Yeah.
19:22:17 <Golly> its on sale so i thought i might try
19:22:24 <Golly> poe never really appealed to me
19:22:43 <Runbunny> It's pretty good.
19:22:49 <Golly> diablo 3 was ok tho, i gather this is somewhere in between?
19:23:27 <DoT`> you ever play titan quest?
19:23:50 <Golly> way back when, it was very good looking but horribly imbalanced
19:24:00 <Golly> and the loot was awful as well lol
19:24:26 <BioSC> pan
19:24:45 <DoT`> loot was aweful?
19:25:10 <DoT`> well its made by the same ppl, got the same level system but also a lot of improvments
19:25:13 <Golly> well i didnt play for long but, enemies would drop tons of garbage
19:25:17 <DoT`> i like it but i also enjoyed TQ
19:25:29 <Golly> and the only decent item i got was for a different class
19:26:28 <Golly> didnt help that my char build was bad, bu i think a lot of the builds were inherently useless
19:27:30 <Golly> this was early on for the game though, so it prob improved later
19:28:18 <Golly> early diablo 3 was god awful as well
19:29:19 <DoT`> so was late d3
19:29:51 <Golly> whenever i need a good laugh i can load up my barbarian whos still in the auction house era gear
19:29:53 <Golly> how so
19:31:05 <Golly> seemed to improve after the expansion, or did something bad happen after that
19:32:23 <DoT`> i guess im just against the skills where compared to D2.

19:33:31 <Golly> i can see that
19:33:54 <DoT`> DvB` calm down
19:34:00 <Golly> but again, as a kid i screwed myself over multiple times with builds that couldnt do higher difficulties
19:34:24 <DoT`> in  D2?
19:34:38 <Golly> yea
19:35:14 <DoT`> ah, later patches they added a skill/attribute reset each difficulty
19:38:11 <Golly> ack
19:40:34 <BioSC>  . splat
19:41:01 <BioSC> out of chili, dun wanna cook. wat do for foodz

22:47:20 <Dot`> camail, genius tactics, wait 9 rounds of taking damage then get him back
22:47:20 <Dot`> lol
22:47:54 <Camail> yea that fight was really bad
22:48:01 <Camail> i've just swept it under the rug and moved on
22:48:40 <Camail> their combat skills have taken a massive downturn since after the break
22:48:58 <Camail> but like..anyone who watches cr for the action probably stopped watching 3 years ago
