19:23:33 <BioSC> come take it away pls
19:25:07 <skrm> sno is da best
19:25:18 <skrm> u ungr8ful brat
19:25:26 <Dot`> snow pls
19:27:24 <BioSC> whats it like to be so wrong
19:54:42 <skrm> i dont know, why dont you tell us about it bio
20:22:33 <Camail> i keep trying to get into watching dota
20:22:47 <Camail> but every fucking tournament has breaks that are longer than the games
20:22:51 <Camail> i give up
20:28:19 <Runbunny> I have fallen out of watching esports too.
20:29:23 <Runbunny> I occasionally catch a CS map or two. That is pretty much it.
20:31:31 <Camail> if they had more than 3 matches over the course of 8 hours i'd actually watch
20:32:06 <Camail> i havent watched cs in a very long time, but NA cs is dead so i cant really be motivated to care
20:32:35 <Camail> its a bummer how valorant killed na cs and will most likely die itself
20:42:36 <Golly> problem with dotes for me is keeping up with new heroes and patches when i dont play it
20:43:14 <Golly> and i mostly watch cs becuz rain
20:46:16 <Golly> strangely the thing im most excited about these days is aoe II
20:59:17 <Camail> its rough when all the people you cared about retire
21:00:05 <Camail> and then covid killed tournaments, its rough
