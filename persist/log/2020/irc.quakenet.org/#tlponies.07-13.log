21:28:57 <skram> i dont understand the story behind this
21:29:00 <skram> is it his sister
21:29:05 <skram> is it post-transition anti-mage
21:29:07 <skram> who knows

21:30:19 <Dot`> skram, im going to guess she is a disciple
21:30:21 <Dot`> i dont know why
21:31:07 <skram> why is it called anti-mage persona and not anti-mage's friend who shares the same views on the use of magic then
21:31:47 <Dot`> maybe persona is an anagram, or a acronym
21:31:56 <Dot`> bio is the one to ask, he is a persona expert
21:32:06 <skram> that sounds like a stretch tbh
21:32:32 <Dot`> did you know STALKER is an acronym
21:33:03 <skram> yes thats why its written in all caps
21:33:37 <Dot`> well TRESPASER is writte in all caps and isnt
21:34:35 <skram> its not a real word either i guess
21:34:52 <Dot`> thats just becuase i cant spell
21:34:59 <Runbunny> O:
21:35:38 <skram> eh its not like dota lore makes any sense at all anyway
21:36:25 <Runbunny> Look at Hobs new house Dot`.
