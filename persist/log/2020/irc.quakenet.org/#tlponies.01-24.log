15:46:01 <Cane> skram, it's been awful here too. Finally we're getting a bit of snow to add some nice white landscapes, but the sky decided to dump way too much of it.
15:47:56 <skram> stupid sky
15:49:10 <Runbunny> Don't worry Jonas.
15:49:13 <Runbunny> I get rain as well.
15:49:58 <skram> im going to the north on sunday though, hopefully they have a snow up in trondheim
15:54:34 <Dot|Phone> Is that not one of the planes in Norse mythology

15:56:51 <skram> so its where trond lives and he is not one of the gods y'know

18:49:02 <Runbunny> Hai Camail.
18:49:30 <Runbunny> idk, has been a weird week.
18:50:49 <Camail> yea? weird isn't bad, which is good in its own way
18:51:16 <Camail> i'd rather be confused than sad
18:55:53 <Camail> play any monhun with the local crazy boy?
19:02:48 <Dot|Phone> Runbunny is probably busy watching vtubers 
19:07:09 <carcinisation> he is lost to vtuber hell dot. shouganai
19:07:47 <Dot|Phone> He's happy there and that's what matters
19:10:22 <Dot|Phone> Camail. How was your week? Did you get exiled on paths again? 
19:10:54 <Camail> nah i've stepped away from poe for awhile, will go back before the end to mess around with the HH and do challenges
19:11:07 <Camail> but yea, been doing ok
19:11:24 <Camail> things can be better, they can be worse, it's all good
19:12:36 <Dot|Phone> What you been up to instead of being an exile? 
19:14:08 <Camail> the internet, mostly
19:14:15 <Camail> mount and blade occasionally
19:14:26 <Camail> but thats about it this week
19:14:38 <Camail> gonna start hades eventually
19:14:58 <Camail> gonna be fun to play a bastion-esque game from them again
19:15:20 <Dot|Phone> You looked at battle brothers? 
19:15:28 <Dot|Phone> Hades is fun
19:15:37 <Dot|Phone> Just had a big update I saw too
19:16:10 <Camail> i have never heard of battle brothers, will take a glance
19:16:31 <Camail> yea i havent looked at what the hades update is cuz spoilers, but the game looks so cool
19:16:47 <Camail> super giant is easily in the top 5 game devs
19:17:02 <Camail> they make extremely polished experimental games
19:17:40 <Dot|Phone> Yea. I really like thier at style too
19:18:07 <Dot|Phone> Art 
19:19:09 <Camail> also been meaning to play slay the spire again
19:19:23 <Camail> new character, but i dont have that flame to play anymore
19:19:32 <Camail> which is a shame cuz its the best game of its genre
19:19:51 <Camail> my gripe is that despite the new character, the monsters are the same
19:20:00 <carcinisation> i found a reason i should reinstall it https://www.reddit.com/r/Esperanto/comments/epq856/slay_the_spire_haveblas_en_esperanto/
19:20:11 <Camail> and after you learn every monster pattern on every floor...kinda doesn't feel new
19:20:29 <Camail> reif with the esperanto 
19:20:39 <Dot|Phone> No good mods that mix it up? 
19:21:13 <Camail> there are mods that change some things, but modders arent as good at making StS as the devs are
19:25:39 <Dot|Phone> That's a shame
19:26:14 <Camail> yea, but thats just how i play games
19:26:25 <Camail> 0 or 100
19:26:55 <Cane> Welp, I just finished a two hour session of shovelling snow from three driveways.
19:27:07 <Cane> Norway can stop dropping snow on my head now.
19:28:50 <Camail> not burning enough oil
19:28:56 <Camail> get those carbon emissions up
19:30:02 <Cane> We just found another oil field, we're working on it.
19:30:53 <Dot|Phone> Quick set it on fire 
19:32:26 <Cane> It started snowing really hard halfway through my work, as if to say, "hello Sisyphus, how are you, I'm fine, how's the weather lol"
19:34:46 <carcinisation> it is telling you to read camus
19:41:36 <Camail> never read french authors, and never read existentialists
