09:56:29 <Dot`> zounds, in order to join you have to awnser a question
09:56:32 <reification> dotties <3
09:56:36 <Dot`> whats your favorite cheese
09:56:42 <Zounds> cheddar
09:56:52 <Dot`> nice
09:57:04 <reification> pleb answer :p
09:57:15 <Dot`> all cheese is good cheese
09:57:22 <Dot`> we dont gatekeep cheese
09:57:57 <reification> i guard my cheese very fiercly actually ;p
09:58:23 <Zounds> its not hte only cheese i like but it is my fave
10:02:16 <reification> as long as you don‚Äôt cut the rind off brie it‚Äôs ok‚Ä¶
10:03:41 <Dot`> what if you cut off the rind to eat it 
10:04:09 <reification> weird but not a crime
10:05:04 <Zounds> what do you guys like in your french onion soup
10:06:03 <Zounds> gruy√®re? provolone? something else entirely?
10:06:35 <Runbunny> I'm pretty good.
10:06:57 <reification> i haven‚Äôt had french onion soup in like 20 years, and back then i took what i was given
10:07:14 <Dot`> i dont know if ive ever had french onion soup
10:08:18 <reification> runbun for arknghts how do you register an acount with yostar?
10:09:30 <reification> i would probably go gruyere now zounds as my fave hard cheese
10:13:50 <Zounds> I'm a gruy√©re man myself but I wont complain either way
10:14:53 <Zounds> Cheddar might be the pleb choice but a lunchbox with a cheese 'n branston pickle sammich has seen me through many work days
10:15:12 <Zounds> cheddar*
10:15:21 <reification> oh and remember to be careful in case you are proposed to today! https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/weird-news/tradition-behind-women-proposing-leap-21571801
10:15:25 <Dot`> applewood smoked cheddar is best cheddar
10:15:51 <reification> cheddar is a fine cheese for it‚Äôs uses

10:20:08 <Dot`> hmm
10:20:38 <Rawr|Fone> Hmm
10:24:47 <Runbunny> Yeah Reif that is what I did.
10:27:00 <reification> bun you appear to have missed the word ‚Äúhow‚Äù. where is registration?
10:27:11 <Runbunny> I just pressed the yostar thing, then it wanted me to put in my email and it send me a mail.
10:27:32 <Runbunny> There's a button called send activation code or something I think
10:27:37 <reification> oh it didn‚Äôt send me mail‚Ä¶
10:28:32 <reification> so i assumed you had to sign up elsewhere and just played as guest
10:28:37 <reification> i will try again
10:29:15 <Runbunny> well it went directly to my unwanted mail section
10:35:58 <reification> works now, so no problem
