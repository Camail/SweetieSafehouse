09:03:10 <Dot`> .tell skram BL3 is out on steam!
09:06:18 <Runbunny> Hai.
09:08:22 <Runbunny> I have heard bad things Dot.
09:13:47 <Dot`> oh no
09:13:48 <Dot`> about?
09:15:57 <Runbunny> Story being really bad.
09:16:18 <Dot`> BL3? thats the worst news ive heard all month runbun
09:16:52 <Runbunny> Quote from guy: "If you are in any way invested in the plot of borderlands at all, I would actually recommend against getting it"
09:17:18 <Dot`> :/  wow
09:18:49 <Runbunny> :/
09:19:29 <Runbunny> Get ori instead and then there's 6 days till Doom.
09:28:50 <Dot`> new ori is amazing
09:28:56 <Dot`> would recomend
10:41:43 <Runbunny> O:
10:45:08 <Dot`> i cant recall the last game i bought on release
10:45:14 <Dot`> maybe BL2?
10:45:22 <Dot`> or D3
10:46:54 <Runbunny> Monster hunter for me probably.
10:47:04 <Runbunny> or rather I bought a few.
10:47:11 <Runbunny> Wolcen :S
10:54:09 <Runbunny> Dot`, The danish borders closes in 6 minuts.
10:55:07 <Dot`> QUICK
10:55:09 <Dot`> get to norway
10:55:21 <Dot`> then skram will be forced to take you in as a displaced refugee
10:56:39 <Golly> if anything we should go to denmark
10:56:52 <Golly> norway is like ground zero atm
11:05:52 <Runbunny> lel
11:16:19 <Dot`> hows finalnd doing? they only gather in groups in saunas
11:21:20 <Golly> preparing to take over the world im sure
11:21:29 <Golly> seperately, 1 by 1
11:22:03 <Golly> im assuming they reproduce asexually
11:33:29 <Dot`> 1 continent per finnish
11:52:15 <Runbunny> I think Finland is safe, https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CwlPvS8XEAAN3ix.jpg:large
11:52:30 <Runbunny> Not even close enough to infect anyone else.
11:58:49 <Micen> I just found out West Virginia is the only state in the US that has zero reported cases of the virus. The country roads protect. 
12:09:02 <Runbunny> Are you sure that the states actually have people living in it?
12:10:18 <Micen> my sister had to drive through and had a tire blow out in the state and got it changed there. So there was at least one person there. selling tires.
