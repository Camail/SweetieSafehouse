13:56:42 <skram> Dot!
13:57:16 <skram> Good morning you old rascal
14:03:47 -!- BioPhone [~androirc@12.33.239.117] has joined #tlponies
14:05:11 <Dot`> i am now officialy an uncle skram
14:05:12 <Dot`> SO OLD
14:05:49 <skram> congrats Dot`
14:06:16 <skram> being an uncle is the best role
14:06:35 <Dot`> skram, more importantly it looks like dnd is going to get a wild magic barbarian
14:06:47 <skram> who?
14:07:06 <skram> and what do you mean more importantly
14:07:16 <Dot`> wht you mean who
14:07:23 <skram> im gonna tell your big bro that dnd is more important than his BABBY
14:08:29 <skram> im still partially asleep and i misread that doot
14:08:43 <skram> i thought it was coming to our campaign
14:09:17 <Dot`> lucky for me i believe my brother understands my dum humour
14:10:11 <skram> what fortune
14:10:38 <Dot`> i know wild magic is the only magic you like and barbarian is the only class you like
14:10:44 <Dot`> hopefull it will be good
14:11:11 <skram> i also like necromancy
14:11:39 <Dot`> thats THE WORST magic
14:13:44 <skram> naw its alright
14:14:50 <Dot`> what magic is worse than necromancy according to skrim?
14:15:01 <skram> druid magic
14:15:16 <Dot`> thats not a type
14:15:39 <skram> i have decided that it is
14:16:05 <Dot`> thats a convincing argument
14:17:09 <Dot`> but i still believe being ablt to teleport through trees, call down lighting storms and summon hoards of badgers to fight for you is better than bringing a smelly dead guy back as a weak zombie
14:17:23 <skram> disagree
14:17:52 <Dot`> how can one man be so wrong
14:17:52 <skram> besides, the best spell in all of dnd is necrotic
14:17:56 <skram> Finger Guns
14:18:25 <Dot`> you can caste disintegrate as a better finger guns
14:18:34 <Dot`> tthats evocation
14:18:35 <skram> no
14:18:39 <skram> those are the wrong finger guns
