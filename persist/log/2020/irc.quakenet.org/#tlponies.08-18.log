11:48:13 <Runbunny> I'm pretty good, my family is coming over tomorrow, so I had to clean my room and do laundry and go buy supplies soonish
11:49:09 <reification> gj getting properly prepared
11:49:38 <reification> it is time once again to go and get government subsidised food :D
11:55:47 <Runbunny> O:
11:55:49 <Dot`> That sounds nice

12:08:19 <Golly> fml
12:08:58 <Golly> turns out my 144hz screen only gets it with dvi, but my new card only has displayport and hdmi slots
12:09:11 <Golly> so now im stuck on 60hz
12:10:11 <Dot`> Thats very annoying
12:12:31 <Golly> technology always seems like it takes steps back as well as forward
12:18:16 <Runbunny> Isn't there an adapter you can get?
12:18:51 <Golly> aye but its expensive
12:18:57 <Golly> may as well buy a new screen
12:20:13 <Runbunny> Really? I see a 2 meter cable for like 60 dkk. Like 10 dollars.
12:20:25 <Golly> the cable is not the problem
12:20:31 <Golly> my screens dont have DP
12:20:39 <Golly> and hdmi only supports 60hz
12:20:42 <Golly> from what i can tell
12:21:56 <Golly> there are adapters i think, to connect dvi to dp or whatever, but those are expensive I think
12:22:06 <Runbunny> Ahh I see.
12:23:51 <Dot`> any chance you can return the screen?
12:24:02 <Golly> nah its like 5yo
12:25:16 <Dot`> ah
12:26:03 <Runbunny> That is unfortunate.
12:26:23 <Runbunny> Anyhoo time to go to the store.
12:26:34 <Golly> i was hoping to keep using it since im doin 1080p gaming for a while longer
12:26:52 <Golly> yea after paycheck its time for a new one
13:18:34 <Runbunny> Going outside was a mistake.
13:18:49 <Runbunny> Now I am sweating all over.

15:20:57 <Rawr|Fone> This summer is too hot
15:22:33 <skrm> its winter soon, henrik
15:22:35 <skrm> thankfully
15:22:59 <Rawr|Fone> Not soon enough
15:25:26 <Runbunny> Winter come faster!
15:26:33 <Dot`> best we can offer is nuclear winter
15:27:55 <Runbunny> Radiation though.
15:28:52 <Dot`> well, maybe we get cat girls from it
15:29:25 <Runbunny> That would be too coincidental.
15:29:47 <Runbunny> Cancer is way more likely.
15:29:55 <skrm> would you headpat an irradiated catperson
15:30:47 <Golly> 90 seconds each
15:32:25 <Golly> thats a lifetime dose though so you may want to spread it out

17:38:19 <Camail> my opinion will probably stay the same. absolutely 0 risk to gain map control and positioning information so everything ends up being a site hold
