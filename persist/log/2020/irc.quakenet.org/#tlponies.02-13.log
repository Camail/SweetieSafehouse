00:00:23 <Camail> WEEBS have either of you watched that prostitute show that funimation cancelled
00:00:26 -!- Rawr|Fone [~AndChat52@c-94cfe455.020-164-6d6c6d4.bbcust.telenor.se] has joined #tlponies
00:00:39 <Camail> its _just_ porn
00:00:56 <DuB`> the wha
00:01:13 <Camail> ishuzoku reviewers
00:01:40 <Camail> its a monster girl anime, that turned into hentai mid season and funimation freaked out and cancelled it
00:01:48 <Camail> but its was getting a simul-cast dub so luuuuuuuuuuul
00:01:52 <Camail> that fucked up
00:02:53 <DuB`> The entire show is them going to brothels
00:03:02 <DuB`> I'm not sure what else could have resulted from this
00:03:03 <DuB`> lol
00:03:58 <Camail> apparently the manga was pretty tame but the animation house turned it to 11
00:04:21 <Camail> Runbunny  have you heard about it
00:04:22 <DuB`> "Hah, GOTCHA!"
00:05:12 <Camail> the premise is interesting, because 90% of the characters are like " this hot  300 year old elf is disgusting, give us this this young 55 year old human"
00:05:14 <Camail> but THEN
00:05:19 <Camail> it just turns to porn
00:05:22 <Camail> a real bait and switch
00:07:40 <Runbunny> Yeah. Reification knows more about it than me though
00:11:15 <Runbunny> Hmm
00:11:29 <Runbunny> For some reason Ublock just disabled all my filters.
00:12:56 <Camail> did you have custom filters?
00:13:03 <Runbunny> Nope. 
00:13:03 <Camail> i only ever use the default
00:13:06 <Camail> weird.
00:13:16 <Camail> reinstall, i guess
00:13:26 <Runbunny> I added some region specific filters.
00:13:36 <DuB`> Time for kebab get 
00:13:40 <Camail> do it
00:13:42 <Runbunny> Nah, no need, it's quite easy to add filters.
00:13:49 <Runbunny> I'm gonna go sleep though
00:13:51 <Camail> i'd forget what i added >_>
00:13:57 <Camail> good night roon of boons
00:14:02 <Camail> dream of rooning boons
00:14:09 <Runbunny> oh boy I hope so.
00:14:13 <Camail> fluffy
00:14:49 <Camail> i hope runbun cheers up eventually
00:14:52 <Camail> he's a sad bun
00:20:22 <reification> ishuzoku reviewers is the only thing i'm watching this season
00:20:30 <DuB`> rofl
00:20:53 <reification> not surprised funi and the like got caught out
00:21:07 <Camail> there's some fun stuff that they do
00:21:28 <reification> so far it's doing a good job of having twists given the very simple premise
00:21:35 <Camail> being open to sexual concepts is interesting there's a lot to talk about
00:21:42 <Camail> but also like...there's a lot of sex
00:21:48 <Camail> th hyena scene....
00:23:31 <Camail> we always ask what a world with harpies would be like
00:23:54 <Camail> in witcher they are monsters, in this show you can fuck them
00:23:58 <Camail> two side of the same coin
00:24:02 <reification> funny that murenase seton gakuen would also have a hyena girl at the same time
00:24:29 <Camail> hyena have a lot to work with, in that region
00:30:32 <reification> night all
00:31:57 <Camail> nn
