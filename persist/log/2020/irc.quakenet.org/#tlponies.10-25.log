21:28:14 <Dot`> big hats and tacos?
21:28:19 <Dot`> and siestes
21:29:22 <Golly> people go there for vacations to shop and get drunk
21:36:59 <Runbunny> Swedes and Norwegians come here to get cheap beer. 
21:37:08 <Runbunny> We go to Germany to get cheap beer.
21:38:39 <Golly> you'd think we would be clever enough to skip the middle man
21:38:46 <Golly> probably too drunk tho
21:38:59 <Runbunny> Same.
21:39:38 <Runbunny> Anyhoo, it's time to go to work.
23:05:08 <skram> Dot`
23:05:33 <Dot`> Skram
