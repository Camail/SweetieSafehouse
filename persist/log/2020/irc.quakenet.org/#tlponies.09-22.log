11:02:33 <Dot`> nice snek
11:56:15 <Dot`> so i may have just caused an audit at a billing company
11:56:43 <Golly> panic?
11:57:13 <Dot`> apprently 2 months ago i was suppose to change where i was sending my rent. but no one told me and no one even noticed last month that they didnt see my money
11:57:36 <Dot`> it was only this month where for some reason my rent took a few days to go through that i got an email saying i was late paying
11:58:33 <Dot`> so i called them and sorted it out for the past 2 months, then 10 minutes later get a call from a guy at the billing company wanting to confirm when my rent payments have been made as they cant find them and they are doing an audit
11:58:47 <Dot`> its been a 'fun' morning
12:01:18 <Golly> fun fun fun
12:02:49 <CockRoach|42> sounds pretty chill :)
12:17:59 <Runbunny> Yay.
