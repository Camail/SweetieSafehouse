15:22:50 <Dot`> Dub
15:22:53 <Dot`> im so sleepy
15:23:14 <DuB`> Dot
15:23:35 <DuB`> Have you tried a nap
15:24:54 <Dot`> a bit, still sleepy
15:44:03 <DuB`> Friday and monday off work!
15:44:06 <DuB`> Yayholiday
15:48:08 <Dot`> \o/
15:54:56 <DuB`> Dot halp
15:55:02 <Dot`> picnic
15:55:19 <DuB`> Every article about the nvidia release starts with, "First of all, RIP to anyone who bought a 2080ti recently..."
15:55:27 <Dot`> ouch
15:55:33 <Dot`> though maybe its time i upgrade....
15:56:00 <DuB`> Certainly seems to be the ideal gpu gen
16:11:08 <BioSC> luckily i bought a 2070, so i'm good
16:15:23 <Dot`> im still running a gtx 970 i got from yolt
16:15:32 <Dot`> it appears they came out in 2014
16:15:56 <Runbunny> O:
16:16:03 <Runbunny> I have a GTX 970 as well.
16:16:29 <Dot`> its a bit tired but still runnign games
16:16:54 <skram> it helps when you only play games made before 2012
16:17:47 <Dot`> well ive yet to find a new game that runs as well as ld games
16:17:50 <Dot`> they all seem to lag
16:17:59 <Dot`> game developers need to fix thier games
16:21:42 <skram> pfft no
16:21:45 <skram> that costs money
16:22:27 <Dot`> there is a reason i guess i only get 30fps on tarkov
16:22:39 <Dot`> and random lag spikes
16:22:41 <Dot`> hmm

16:27:29 <Runbunny> Probably your CPU.
16:29:49 <Dot`> thats an i7 3.4ghz
16:29:55 <Dot`> its been doing fine
16:30:16 <Dot`> oh, its from 2012
16:30:43 <skram> narrator: it had not been doing fine
16:31:15 <Dot`> well it doesnt have a choice
16:35:08 <Runbunny> :D
16:41:17 <DuB`> O dear dot
16:41:18 <DuB`> haha
16:43:23 <Runbunny> I'll buy some upgrades when I am in the money.
16:45:38 <Dot`> same bun, but where is this money?
16:48:18 <Runbunny> Well Dot, you can sell your life energy for money, even easier if you give up on all your hopes and dreams.
16:56:29 <Dot`> tempting
16:56:38 <BioSC> but if he hopes and dreams for new cpu parts, is not gud
17:15:37 <BioSC> asdf
17:18:57 <Rawr|Fone> Fdsa
17:21:07 <BioSC> i agree
17:21:58 <Dot`> im unconvinced
17:22:38 <Golly> clearly you need to overclock it
17:40:23 <Runbunny> Dot`?

19:04:49 <reification> i return from watching tenet
19:05:14 <Dot|Phone> Was it good? Also was their good spacing with the seats? 
19:05:57 <reification> there has only been a handful of ppl in cinema both times i've been post lockdown so spacing is easy
19:06:34 <reification> if you liked inception you should like it
19:06:53 <reification> playing braid beforehand would be good to get in the right mindset
