14:57:37 <Dot`> angel!
14:58:09 <Runbunny> Hai Dot.
14:58:22 <Dot`> how are you today
14:58:43 <Runbunny> pretty good. 
14:59:19 <Runbunny> I had a crash course in a robot today, even though it was my day off.
14:59:29 <Dot`> whats the robit do?
14:59:31 <Runbunny> Soooooooo I got to work as well
15:01:12 <Runbunny> It's a liquid handler, so there's lots of programming and stuff.
15:01:47 <Dot`> fancy
15:02:03 <Dot`> whats it programmed in?
15:02:40 <Runbunny> Well it does take javascripts and visual basics.
15:02:41 <reify> will you be able to make cyborg catgirls now bun?
15:02:53 <Runbunny> But you can just program it in the software.
15:03:07 <Runbunny> Sadly no, Reif my boy.
15:05:32 <Dot`> java is the worst runbun
15:07:20 <Runbunny> But it's javascript. Can't lose faith Dot.
15:08:44 <Dot`> VB is ok
15:09:50 <reify> javascript is unrelated to java dotties
15:10:08 <Dot`> i dont recall which i did in school so i stay clear of both
15:10:12 <reify> they changed the name from actionscript… to sound trendy
15:10:42 <Dot`> though i did not know there was 2  javas
15:12:38 <reify> javascript is a nifty prototype-based language that has to suffer being used only for silly things in web browsers :(
15:15:10 <Runbunny> Well there is also the java coffee brand the language was named after.
15:17:26 <reify> there is also the most populated island in the world :p
15:20:10 <Dot`> all to be avoided
