00:08:22 <Dot`> another co-op game lost
00:09:21 <skram> but the real win condition was the friendship we made along
00:10:33 <Dot`> with the bugs?
00:10:41 <Dot`> with the amount you got infected
00:11:23 <Dot`> another normal game, then we add expansions

00:48:11 <Runbunny> Jonas, yes that is the point.
00:52:17 <Crisium> well a tree just fell onto our patio awning
00:52:28 <Crisium> luckily only damaged that but if tree broke higher would have hit the house proper

00:54:31 <skram> ?
00:54:42 <Crisium> it is windy cause a storm is brewing so i guess
00:54:57 <Crisium> it's been windier before, but i guess this was the straw that broke the camel's back
00:55:38 <skram> well looks like you got lucky, all things considered
00:55:53 <skram> free firewood tho \o/
