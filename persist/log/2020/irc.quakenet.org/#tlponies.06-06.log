17:43:13 <Dot`> cam, who do we have for board games
17:43:51 <Camail> me you and dub, at least
17:45:05 <Dot`> reification?
17:46:48 <reification> saturday evenings are no good dotties :(
17:47:14 <Camail> at this very second i'm doing nerdy poe stuff, but maybe in like 20 minutes i can start a game
18:36:28 <Camail> DuB` Dot`  downloaded some stuff, we can mess around whenever
18:42:06 <Dot`> i have food soon but can game later, what you found?
18:44:33 <Camail> tons of stuff we haven't played yet. those deck building games, gloomhaven, sheriff of nottingham, coup, connect one,king of tokyo
18:47:41 <Dot`> ive had a quick look at gloomhaven before, as it crops up all the time when ppl are recomending board games, its like an odd DnD lite with no DM?
18:48:14 <Dot`> and the same guys just brought out frosthaven, which seems to be simler
18:48:57 <Dot`> SHeriff of notinghim ive seen, but dont know anything about it, dontknow the others
18:55:55 <Camail> sheriff of nottingham is a game about smuggling and bluffing
18:56:26 <Camail> i havent actually looked at gloomhaven at all
18:56:34 <Camail> just looked cool and big
19:18:52 <Runbunny> oh right Hob was streaming a long time today.
