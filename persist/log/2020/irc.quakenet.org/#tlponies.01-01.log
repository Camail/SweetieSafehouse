23:02:14 <skram> gmornin
23:02:34 <Rial> What is everyone up to? Today I'm going to eat at an indian curry place
23:02:59 <Rawr|Fone> It's midnight, so almost time for bed
23:03:32 <Micen> getting ready to cook some country ribs, then go back to staring at steam and try to find something in the 5-12 dollar range i want to buy. 
23:04:03 <reification> i have been test solving very hard sudoku puzzles but now it is too late so i stop for today
23:04:12 <Micen> currently debating between Stardew Valley, and Them's fighting herds. 
23:04:22 <skram> Im reading a manga about... perverts, I think?
23:04:33 <Micen> Skram, all manga is about perverts
23:04:55 <skram> maybe but not all of them have dogs and squid people in them
23:05:04 <Micen> only the good ones. 
23:05:25 <reification> oh how terrible skram.... but which one in particular would this be? >.>
23:05:29 <skram> fair
23:05:34 <skram> Oddman 11
23:05:45 <Micen> Reif asking the real questions.
23:06:34 <reification> nice summary "An after school club originally founded on the obsession of Fish Cakes, containing girl members with odd kinky traits and a male member who has trouble maintaining a relationship longer than a month."
23:07:18 <skram> While all of that is certainly true its much more mad than that
23:14:17 <reification> does that mean you will be getting full strength curry rial?
23:14:39 <reification> not the regular mild japanese variety
23:16:31 <Micen> i still have yet to try a curry.  maybe i should make some at some point. 
23:17:15 <reification> i cannot manage spicy food, my uncle was from sri lanka and nothing he would call curry would be edible for me
23:17:20 <Rial> I love indian curry =w= but I won't get it max spicy this time. It needs p;ractice
23:17:33 <Rial> Micen, I might have an extra copy of Stardew Valley, if you want. 
23:17:35 <skram> micen just do a thai curry
23:17:42 <skram> easy peasy and tasty as h e c k
23:17:53 <Micen> if you do, that would be great!
23:18:13 <Micen> got a specific recipe skram? 
23:19:10 <skram> Not really, its just curry saus + coconut milk + whatever meat you like + whatever veggies you like
23:19:27 <reification> don't you already live in the countryside micen? you can just go outside to play stardew valley :p
23:19:36 <Rial> lol
23:19:41 <Micen> ground not suitable for turnip growth.
23:19:53 <skram> I usually do chicken, unsalted peanuts, spring onions, onions, peppers
23:22:26 <Micen> that sounds good. 
23:23:48 <skram> Its pretty great, serve with naan or noodles or rice
23:24:22 <Micen> Always have rice on hand so thats easy. 
23:24:33 <Micen> I should also try to make my own pasta at some point 
23:24:55 <skram> sounds like a nightmare unless you have a pasta machine
23:25:09 <Micen> I have a knife and a rolling pin. I am the machine. 
23:26:17 <skram> go on then
