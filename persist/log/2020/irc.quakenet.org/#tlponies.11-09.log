22:40:45 <skram> DOT
22:41:01 <skram> whats up
22:41:15 <Dot`> I missed you
22:41:21 <skram> <3
22:41:34 <Dot`> <3
22:41:36 <Dot`> how was work?
22:41:58 <skram> busy AND boring
22:42:03 <skram> good to be home
22:42:18 <Dot`> oh dear
22:42:45 <skram> did you go to leeds again today
22:43:27 <Dot`> nope, ive finished my leeds business
22:43:45 <Dot`> but tomorow i do need to go into the office which is 30 minutes walk away
22:44:03 <Dot`> probably need to go in for about 2 weeks for PLC/LOI/SCADA testing
22:44:14 <Dot`> got to set it all up and simulate stuff
22:44:50 <skram> sounds relaxing
22:44:53 <skram> even get a free walk!
22:46:00 <Dot`> its not too bad i guess
22:54:26 <skram> are you still working on the water treatment stuff or do you have a new project
22:55:44 <Dot`> this is the Hull sludgeg dewatering
22:55:58 <Dot`> ive been on it a few months now i guess
22:56:40 <Dot`> most of our jobs are with Yorkshire water, so water in some ways
23:03:24 <skram> at what part do you add the chemicals that make the frogs gay?
23:04:37 <Crisium> skram https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JRLCBb7qK8
23:04:52 <Dot`> what do you tihnk the poly is?
23:05:07 <Dot`> its even pink
23:06:05 <skram> :O
23:06:22 <skram> dot is the guy he's talking about apparently, Crisium
23:56:27 <Camail> skram how has hades been
23:56:51 <Camail> i havent played it but lately but like half the streamers i watch have been picking it up
23:57:23 <skram> Its been alright, have taken a break since dying to hades like 3 times though
23:57:57 <Camail> yea he takes awhile
23:58:09 <skram> im real bad at dodging shit apparently
23:58:30 <skram> I can get there pretty reliably so I just need to learn the fight well i reckon
23:59:58 <Camail> you should focus on getting the athena dash, and use achille's trinket
