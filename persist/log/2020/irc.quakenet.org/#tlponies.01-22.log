12:38:58 <Runbunny> Jonas some thought was giving to this.
12:39:14 <Runbunny> But there was a collab stream where they all were in the same room.
12:39:39 <Runbunny> and you can't correct all the voices at the same time.
12:39:56 <Dot|Phone> Your saying a bunch of digital avatars where in the same room? 
12:40:15 <skram> yes lol
12:40:19 <Runbunny> Yes.
12:40:46 <skram> theres one who has a really deep voice though
12:40:47 <reimeuk> holo is great but can't miss out on ars and roa
12:41:14 <skram> or maybe its normal but compared to the rest it sounds like tay zonday
