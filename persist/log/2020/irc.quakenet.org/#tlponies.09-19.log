15:32:19 <reification> do not go near fate go, play arknights with us instead
15:34:20 <reification> finally learn japanese and translate mahoutsukai no yoru so we can all enjoy it at last D:
15:36:50 <BioSC> sounds degenerate
15:37:09 <reification> oh right also read the fate zero novel after playing fate s/n, it's done by the madoka chap
15:37:56 <reification> your radar for degeneracy is still functioning bio

18:22:04 <Camail> yo
18:22:24 <skrma> cam
18:22:27 <Camail> skram
18:22:28 <skrma> are you doing poe
18:42:59 <Dot|Phone> Probably finished it already
18:47:40 <Camail> i am doing the poe yes
18:47:49 <Camail> starting in maps, still very squishy
18:48:10 <Camail> i am much squishier than usual but its fine
18:48:38 <skrma> what sorta build you doing this time around
18:58:55 <Golly> <Camail> blazing salvo mines
18:59:43 <Camail> yes, and its fun
19:00:10 <Camail> some people dont like blazing salvo but i think they are dumb
19:00:15 <Camail> and must be building it wrong
19:02:32 <Dot|Phone> Runbun. How's your build going? 
19:38:05 <Runbunny> Pretty alright
19:38:39 <Runbunny> Some stuff I didn't knew, probably since I haven't played with intensify before. 
19:38:57 <Runbunny> It doesn't trigger off spell echo. So I can't use that :S

20:31:56 <reification> also dub bun ^
20:33:39 <Camail> Runbunny yea, the word "use" is , frustratingly, a keyword. Anything that says use means that it must come from a player's key press. so no mines, totems, repeats, unleash, trigger, completely negates absolutely everything
20:33:43 <Camail> its mildly lame
