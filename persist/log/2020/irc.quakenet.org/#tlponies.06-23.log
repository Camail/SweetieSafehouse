00:11:10 <Runbunny> I think he just forgot.
00:11:21 <Runbunny> Even for like 3 sekiro splits.
00:12:27 <Dot|Phone> He was on a completely different game
00:17:03 <Runbunny> He doesn't have all the variations.
00:17:19 <Runbunny> So the splits can't actually be in any order.
00:25:22 <Dot|Phone> Really? Never seen it before
00:25:46 <Runbunny> Use your imagination as Hob says :)
00:26:37 <Dot|Phone> I used my alloted imagination today already
00:35:22 <skrm> what did you spend it on
00:36:07 <Runbunny> I hope you were thinking about something nice, that made you happy Dot.

12:08:14 <Micen> because i think thats my next one. 
12:08:47 <reification> i was just about to mention it again
12:08:52 <Dot`> always reif
12:09:46 <Micen> top of the list, followed by Golden Boy
12:10:42 <Dot`> runbuns favourite
12:11:39 <reification> i found out the other day urusei yatsura is getting republished and done properly this time, so i shall have to get that
12:12:22 <Micen> yep. then my brother's current favorite. Dorohedero. 
12:13:33 <reification> interesting "It tells the story of the amnesiac reptilian-headed Caiman working together with his friend Nikaido to recover his memories and survive in a strange and violent world."
12:14:02 <Micen> ive seen the first four episodes. and its super interesting.  
12:15:02 <Micen> also they do this interesting thing in the post credits where they go over what was learned in the investigation that episode. 
12:15:38 <Micen> My brother, who doesnt watch much anime. has seen it like 3 times through and the first season has only been finished since march. 
12:15:50 <reification> i intend to use the current hidive 30day free trial to watch a lot 
12:16:02 <Micen> and said he will watch it a 4th with me if i want.
12:16:19 <reification> that is a stamp of approval
12:16:56 <Micen> i tihnk dorohedero is a netflix exclusive. 
12:17:29 <reification> ah then it will have to wait
12:17:38 <Micen> at least it was only shown netflix jp, then came to netflix us. 
12:17:52 <Micen> yeah if you have a service, use it to its fullest. 
12:18:36 <Micen> somewhere down the line i guess i will watch jojo as well. 
12:20:02 <Micen> maybe after i finish DBS 
12:20:14 <Micen> and the original dragonball. 
12:20:23 <Micen> and finally finish Ranma 1/2
12:57:59 <Runbunny> reification!
12:58:08 <Runbunny> You missed a Wakame stream earlier.

13:10:06 <Mousen|Droid> Reif. I'm sold on the first episode. Will binge the rest when I wake up. 
13:10:42 <reification> excellent <3
13:12:00 <Mousen|Droid> I just can't stand the like 12 minutes of ads I'm getting on funimations mobile app 
13:12:35 <Mousen|Droid> Watching half an episodes worth of ads is pretty bad. Esp since its American political ad season. 
13:12:49 <reification> when there are too many ads for an american to deal with you have gone way to far :p
13:13:40 <Mousen|Droid> Yeah. And it's not even at the normal ad break fades. It's in the middle of things. 
13:13:46 <reification> i saw american tv when i went to new england 20 years ago and it was near unwatchable from ad breaks to a brit used to the bbc
13:14:15 <reification> wow that's a combo of lazy and obnoxious
13:15:11 <Mousen|Droid> Six ad breaks in 24mins 
13:15:27 <Mousen|Droid> Including Preroll ads. 
13:16:42 <Mousen|Droid> I mean it's all we know. And the way it feeds ads. I'll see the same ad 3 times in a row. So 3 of the exact political candidate ads, then one telling you to ask your doctor about this new drug.
