13:11:34 <skrm> is it erotic fanfiction again Runbunny
13:13:10 <Runbunny> Yes.
13:14:34 <Runbunny> It's about a guy called "Bonas" who owns a old volvo 740 and has a big dick.
13:23:49 <Golly> i'd give it a 2/3
13:48:51 <skrm> nothing makes bonas excited like the exquisite lack of curves on the volvo 740
13:48:59 <skrm> the daringly steep angle of the rear window
13:49:19 <skrm> the sensual accordian effect on the front bumpers
13:55:54 <Golly> the loving touch of the 3 point seatbelt
13:58:37 <skrm> the reassuring presence of the lambda sensor

16:07:33 <Cane> Afternoon everyone. <3
16:08:24 <Cane> https://www.twitch.tv/esl_dota2 is live with what should be the grand finals of Liquid vs Na'Vi.
16:08:36 <Rawr|Fone> Good evening cane
16:09:06 <Cane> Hi Rawr! Hope you're doing well. =)
16:09:46 <Cane> Golly, enjoying Grim Dawn?
16:10:21 <Golly> its was okish untill i unlock dual wielding pistols
16:10:24 <Golly> now its great
16:10:32 <Cane> Hahah, how far in are you?
16:11:02 <Golly> idk, i think act one moving my way up the left side of map
16:15:47 <Dot`> was the game split into acts? i should replay it
16:17:12 <Dot`> Liquid need more birb
16:25:23 <Kittybunny> It's kinda split into acts.
16:37:27 <Dot`> time for liquid throw?
16:49:35 <Dot`> skrm
17:07:45 <Cane> It's not actually split into acts, not exactly.
17:07:55 <Cane> It's one fairly seamless world, which is actually one of my complaints about the game.
17:08:09 <Cane> Everything looks very similar.
17:09:09 <Dot`> it does leave you expecting something, some break to split it, and it never happens
17:09:13 <Cane> Yep.
17:09:29 <Cane> There's no natural break points, no "holy shit we did it, okay, breather time, let's prepare for the next leg of the journey."
17:09:37 <Cane> It's like reading a very, very long book without chapters.
17:10:09 <Cane> You never know how important chapters are until they're gone.
17:13:33 <skrm> Dot`
17:13:51 <Dot`> ah there you are
17:13:57 <Dot`> you surviving work?
17:14:31 <skrm> If I dont survive these last 45 minutes im gonna be proper mad
17:14:53 <Dot`> miffed
17:15:31 <skrm> quite so
17:20:01 <Dot`> Liquid BANNED tree? i feel betrayed
17:20:46 <skrm> liquid hates natuer confirmed
17:30:23 <Cane> Insania is stupidly good on that hero, freaking hell.
17:44:17 <Cane> Liquid is having more luck with the EG strat of "all other cores die and make space until RTZ/Micke is super farmed and then we win" than EG.
17:45:41 <Dot`> LIQUID!
17:47:55 <Cane> Micke you MADLAD
17:48:22 <Cane> "I have 15% life. STORM HAMMER PAST THE TIER 3 TOWER BRRRR
17:49:59 <Dot`> lol
17:52:15 <Cane> I can't imagine Na'Vi will be able to deal with this Sven at all.
17:52:38 <Cane> Taiga with the game winner.
17:52:47 <Cane> gg
17:52:48 <Dot`> gg
17:56:06 <Cane> Liquid is looking so strong these days.
17:57:04 <Cane> Nazgul's approach of "bring these people on board and give them assets AND TIME to find their groove and flourish" is so refreshing in a scene where team rosters change between TI seasons.
