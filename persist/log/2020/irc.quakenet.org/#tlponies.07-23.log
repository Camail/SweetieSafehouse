16:51:54 <Dot`> gettign a garden yet?
16:53:19 <DuB`> Dot` Cane, STALKER 2 trailer and announcement in the xbox showcase going on, apparently :O
16:53:27 <Dot`> WAT
16:53:28 <DuB`> https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-xbox-series-x-stalker-2
16:53:40 <Dot`> im now worried
16:53:43 <Dot`> why there???
16:53:58 <Dot`> but also 
16:54:00 <Dot`> STALKER
16:54:20 <Crisium> vidya games
16:54:32 <Dot`> why xbox?
16:55:18 <Rawr|Fone> No garden dot
16:55:28 <Dot`> one day rawr, then doggo!
16:55:37 <Rawr|Fone> Yes!
16:55:39 <Rawr|Fone> 12
16:56:15 <Rawr|Fone> Also, moving closer to the gym
16:57:45 <Cane> Yeah, it'll be on Xbox as well then. I'm not surprised--PC exclusives are rare as balls these days.
16:58:09 <Cane> So we'll have to take the good with the bad. "Streamlined" gameplay dumbed down for controllers, but polished to a mirror shine to make sure it doesn't explodde.
16:59:23 <Dot`> then we just wait a year or 2 for some proper modding cane, to give that good unforgiving gameplay with just the right amount of game breaking bugs
16:59:46 <Dot`> they are like meta anomalies
17:00:28 <Cane> I think Yahtzee had a funny joke about that--in Clear Sky, the player had control over the most powerful and mystical of all anomalies: The quicksave button.
17:00:55 <Dot`> LORE
17:03:19 <Cane> I wonder how mods will be handled. I'd be concerned if modding was severely limited due to it almost certainly being on the Microsoft store so they can enforce Windows 10 for it.
17:05:12 <Dot`> its simpler, once we see stalker 2 we can mod stalker 1 to be stalker 2 and then mod that
17:05:26 <Dot`> simple*
17:07:15 <Runbunny> That feeling when you don't want to cook some food but it's only thursday.
17:11:56 <DuB`> skram, just ordered 4th set of replacement earpads for the momentums. These headphones might just last forever...
17:15:05 <Dot`> how long you had them dub?
17:15:18 <DuB`> 5 years now

17:45:00 <skram> :O you can get replacements?
17:45:12 <skram> mine are kinda bad and ive only had them for 4 years
17:45:53 <DuB`> I replace them every year or so, they really soak up skins oils etc and get yucky
17:47:38 <skram> yeah i had to wash mine with engine degreaser last week
17:51:46 <DuB`> Heavy duty :P
17:53:49 <Dot`> what you doing this weekend skram
17:55:28 <skram> some relatives from the west is coming over
17:57:02 <skram> maybe have a GT, maybe not
17:57:07 <skram> who knows
17:59:17 <Dot`> solid planning
18:09:01 <DuB`> Man, dieting is eeeeasy
18:09:23 <DuB`> Realized I haven't had breakfast yet at 2pm, and I'm just... still not hungry
18:09:25 <DuB`> Hm
18:10:34 <skram> i dont think dieting and fasting are the same things
18:11:01 <DuB`> Hmm
18:11:49 <DuB`> What if I have a salad for dinner
18:12:22 <Dot`> then you will have eaten a salad for dinner
18:12:38 <Dot`> this doesnt seem like a complex question dubs
18:54:34 <skram> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53me-ICi_f8&feature=youtu.be
18:54:37 <skram> thanks, uncle roger
19:25:09 <Runbunny> Uncle Roger is hilarious.
20:04:28 <skram> now rice stinky like you :(
20:15:25 <DuB`> .choose pizza kebab burrito burger italian
20:26:38 <skram> werent you dieting
20:26:57 <DuB`> Just fasting, apparently :P
20:27:40 <skram> well the best way to get healthy is to not eat for a whole day and then eat 3500 calories
20:31:03 <DuB`> 1000 at most!
20:34:43 <Dot`> dub only buys pizza in single slices
20:34:48 <Dot`> like a city boy
20:39:32 <Dot`> skram, why does she was the rice AFTER cooking it?
20:39:38 <Dot`> even i know this is wrong
20:39:50 <Dot`> british ppl cooking
20:41:45 <skram> i always wash my rice with a power washer
20:43:17 <Dot`> well as long as you do it before cooking im sure thats perfect
