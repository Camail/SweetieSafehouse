07:55:38 <reification> good morning tlpons
07:59:07 <Dot`> Reef!
08:00:03 <reification> dotties!
08:00:30 <reification> did you win the thing yesterday?
08:01:09 <reification> i was sad about missing it, especially as am busy this eve and tomorrow
08:01:41 <Dot`> no we lost, as is tradition
08:01:45 <reification> but now i have pings fixed and TTS downloaded, so next time...
08:01:54 -!- Rawr|Fone [~AndChat52@c-94cfe455.020-164-6d6c6d4.bbcust.telenor.se] has joined #tlponies
08:01:54 <Dot`> next time i will ping you twice
08:02:06 <reification> the game was nemesis right?
08:02:11 <Dot`> yea
08:02:26 <Dot`> dont know if i will get skram to play that again
08:02:32 <reification> you can always text message me in case i am away from pc and laptop
08:02:46 <Dot`> 2 is also the number of times i got ppl to play eldritch horror before they gave up
08:03:04 <reification> oh, i was thinking of reading rules
08:03:51 <Dot`> someone else reading rules and not having me reapeat myself for 3 hours? sounds weird
08:03:52 <reification> my mum loved playing super hard to win card games so don't expect me to give up without a fight
08:05:22 <reification> i should play some 9 column patience again today
08:05:57 <Dot`> well im up to try nemisis again, and pretty much most board games, we have played terraforming mars once, bio wants to play dune sometime (i dont know the rules except its really complex)
08:06:18 <Dot`> if we can get the ppl again, betrayal on house on the hill was fun
08:06:41 <reification> if the rules to a dune game weren't complex, it wouldn't be right.
08:06:47 <reification> that's a big brain book
08:07:26 <Dot`> haha, i watched a review of it and there is a lot going on
08:08:06 <Dot`> we played dead of winter a few times too, sould try that again, though i dont recall the ruules now
08:08:17 <reification> i've only listened to first audiobook, but imo it deserves its place in the classics
08:09:11 <Dot`> ive never read it, i did play one of the old pc games, does that count for something, i know what spice is and 4 of the houses
08:10:05 <Dot`> oh we also played pandemic a few times on TTS but now its been DCMA'ed so its no longer up
08:14:33 <Dot`> Also you should look at Root or Vast, both by the same guy. They are asyimetrical games, with great art, though i have yet to get the horses to play either yet
08:34:06 <CockRoach|42> hors hors
08:36:08 <Dot`> cr!
08:38:08 <reification> roachorse!
08:38:58 <reification> dot, dune 2000 was the first rts i played :D
08:39:56 <reification> ooh this looks neat: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNl0hY_h0ws
08:40:37 <Dot`> i did play that once, but i had emporer battle for dune
08:40:48 <Dot`> westwood games!

08:53:18 <reification> what did you make of girl intercorrupted skram?
08:53:46 <reification> did you guess correctly?
08:53:55 <skram> ive not gotten that far yet reif
08:54:16 <skram> ive not decided if im just gonna get a kindle or if i have to get the paperback
08:54:18 <Rawr|Fone> I am working on something that has to be done in 2 hours, and then we will be testing 
08:54:31 <Rawr|Fone> Project might go live next week
08:54:37 <reification> aww. you need to be less busy
08:55:02 <reification> that was for skram but maybe rawr too ;p
08:55:35 <skram> well its my week off so im very busy, ill be at work next week so then ill have time to relax
08:56:07 <reification> i like physical books but this is fine for kindle because of its brief length
08:56:27 <skram> Yeah, but i'd need to buy the whole kindle
08:56:33 <reification> hahaha
08:56:56 <reification> you can get the kindle app for your pc for free you know...
08:57:17 <skram> ooooh
08:57:24 <reification> or your phone/tablet
08:57:42 <skram> phones are too small to read on
08:57:46 <skram> ill get the desktop thing
08:58:25 <reification> most stuff i won't read on phones, but the bakemonogatari light novels were a good fit
09:01:21 <skram> anyway, i need to run
