23:24:20 <skram> why dont you multitask and eat a book
23:24:24 <skram> or read some pasta
23:24:32 <DuB`> Penne has not plot

23:24:42 <DuB`> Or paper maybe
23:26:18 <skram> dont you have alphabet pasta
23:26:54 <DuB`> No I'm not a BABY child
23:27:32 <skram> an adult child then
23:27:45 <DuB`> Sounds about right
23:27:56 <DuB`> With grown-up fusilli and penne pastas
