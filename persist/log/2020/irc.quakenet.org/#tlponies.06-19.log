03:07:48 <Camail> DuB`  so you gonna try league start tomorrow? or just chill for week 1 and wait for people to figure stuff out
03:54:10 <DuB`> O, sorry. Will try to play early, but dunno what's what
03:54:14 <DuB`> @ Camail
03:57:23 <Camail> the important thing is to just go through it, knowing whats happening is overrated
03:57:45 <Camail> get a build that kills stuff good, then kill stuff good and engage in the arpg itemization loop
03:58:04 <Camail> everything else happens later
03:59:03 <Camail> i'm playing something similar to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHn-8wvkEBI
03:59:28 <Camail> wait no this is the relevant video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYahj5Tq0a4
04:01:04 <Camail> or enki's arc witch, the best guide in the game https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/1147951
04:02:10 <Camail> my storm brand archmage heiro build was based off karv's tree last league and it was sooo fun
04:02:29 <Camail> so i cant wait to get to end game and do max block trickster ed/con. it seems almost unfair how tanky it is
04:05:37 <DuB`> Looked at a handful of builds and none really stuck out, so I'll try the arc one because why not
