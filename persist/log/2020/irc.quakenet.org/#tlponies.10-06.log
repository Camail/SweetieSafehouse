16:49:44 <Dot`> hmm, you have ajob now, you can get your opwn screen!
16:49:59 <Runbunny> Yeah.
16:50:09 <Runbunny> I have to get paid first though.
16:50:20 <Runbunny> And a new gfx card and headset.
16:50:27 <Runbunny> Maybe new cpu
16:50:48 <Runbunny> but then I need a new motherboard as well probably and then I'd probably have to get new rams as well.
16:51:19 <Golly> i mean if youre gonna get a cpu and gpu, you may as well 
16:51:25 <Dot`> thats a lot of monies
16:52:09 <Golly> harddrives have improved a lot as well
16:53:37 <Runbunny> I already have an NVMe
17:01:06 <Runbunny> I should make a list.

17:52:14 <Dot`> Runbunny, hows hades going?
17:53:32 <Runbunny> Well, I am trying to make artemis work, but all her boons seems kinda bad compared to other choices.
17:53:53 <Runbunny> Her only good thing is like support fire, but I didn't get that one :(
17:57:55 <Dot`> just crit fishing with the rail?
17:59:40 <Runbunny> Nah the sword aspect that gives you a chance to crit if you special.
