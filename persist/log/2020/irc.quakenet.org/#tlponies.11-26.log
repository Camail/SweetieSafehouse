09:32:04 <Rawr|Fone> I beat hades for the first time today dot
09:52:53 <Dot|Phone> Wow that was fast Rawr
09:53:01 <Dot|Phone> What build? 
09:56:46 <Rawr|Fone> I used the bow and upgraded the special with ares upgrade
09:57:03 <Rawr|Fone> Pretty much just that
09:57:13 <Rawr|Fone> And then the athena dash
09:59:01 <Dot|Phone> Is that the multi shot special? 
10:03:40 <Rawr|Fone> Yes
10:04:12 <Rawr|Fone> Every target you hit takes like 200 damage
10:04:26 <Dot|Phone> The only build I have finished the game with
10:04:47 <Rawr|Fone> It seems like it is very effective
10:05:07 <Rawr|Fone> I only did 10 runs or something
10:11:44 <Dot|Phone> I was probably on 20 something when I got that skill
10:12:22 <Dot|Phone> Havn't finished the game since, I can now reliably get to the second phase of hades fight but die there every time

10:56:49 <Dot|Phone> With the gifts you can force specific gods but yea there is still a certain amount of rng
