19:57:52 <Camail> tho it can depends from company to company
20:04:17 <Crisium> most states require yearly inspections
20:04:24 <Crisium> or else you are unlawfully driving the vehicle
20:04:28 <Crisium> some dont, like Ohio i think
20:06:27 <skram> what do they inspect

20:42:06 <skram> robits are pretty good yeah
20:48:11 <Crisium> they said my breaks were close to the mark of not passing the inspection, so i just had them get it over with and replace the pads or whatever
20:48:20 <Crisium> i figure #YOLO with your breaks is not a good idea
20:49:06 <skram> thats a good idea
20:49:21 <skram> but you'll definitly know when the pads are worn all the way down :P

21:01:47 <skram> yeah luckily double circuit brakes are required by law
