23:24:17 <Dot`> Runbun
23:24:43 <Runbunny> Look at Hobs title.
23:25:52 <Dot`> oh dear
23:25:57 <carcinisation> ...
23:25:57 <Dot`> whats he doing to himself!
23:26:52 <Runbunny> Corona virus addled his mind probably.
23:27:30 <Dot`> he added sikero and 1 other?
23:28:21 <Dot`> and is it all bosses? to be truely mad
23:29:48 <Runbunny> He just added sekiro I think
23:31:04 <Runbunny> I don't think it's all bosses.
23:31:09 <Runbunny> He's not insane.
23:31:26 <carcinisation> that'll be the next thing
23:32:37 <Runbunny> I don't think he has done all the games all bosses individually.
23:34:05 <Dot`> was demon souls part of the first god run?
23:34:22 <Dot`> oh yea, it was
23:34:56 <Runbunny> Yeah.
23:36:08 <Zounds> should I be watching this guy
23:36:16 <Zounds> whenever you talk about him he seems to be doing cool stuff
23:37:53 <Dot`> if you like the souls games zounds yes
23:38:01 <Dot`> becuase thats pretty much all he plays
23:38:03 <Runbunny> He's a pretty witty english cunt that's stuck playing dark souls.
23:38:13 <Zounds> I do like Souls games dot
23:38:24 <Zounds> played all of them for hundreds of hours
23:39:11 <Runbunny> His dog is on stream from time to time as well.
23:39:20 <Runbunny> 100% good boy.
23:39:26 <Dot`> its a great dog
