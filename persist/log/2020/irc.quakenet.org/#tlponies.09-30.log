13:47:50 <Runbunny> Dot.
13:48:33 <Runbunny> So here is my shitty plan to make my problems worse.
13:49:05 <Dot`> hand it over
13:49:43 <Runbunny> So I got my friend hired at my job and the other people at the office thinks she and I are dating.
13:50:10 <Runbunny> Which I think would be cool.
13:50:26 <Dot`> this all sounds like a plan so far
13:51:10 <Runbunny> Anyhoo, I thought about texting her and be like "people think we're dating anyways, so you want to do it?"
13:52:43 <Runbunny> Horrendous idea but I might go through with it.
13:53:39 <Dot`> have you thought about asking her for a drink or food after work? its another option. but your way leaves little room for interpretation
13:54:11 <Runbunny> We don't work the same hours, well we do but not the same days.
13:54:28 <Runbunny> And I have known her since like 8 years.
13:55:20 <Dot`> well i believe in you bun
14:11:55 <Dot`> well runbun? im invested now, updates?

20:37:42 <Dot`> your not dead, this is good
20:39:38 <Golly> so nerds, friends and me are playing baldurs gate 1, my cleric is lvl 4 but only has access to lvl 1 and 2 spells
20:39:40 <Golly> what gives
20:39:47 <Golly> its hard to google the answer
20:42:24 <Dot`> is your wisdom high enough?
20:42:32 <Golly> maxed
20:43:01 <Dot`> hmm, that was my only guess from knowing how 3rd ed worked
20:43:08 <Golly> its 2nd ed
20:43:21 <Dot`> well yea, but my knowledge only goes so far back
20:43:26 <Golly> glorious thac0
20:44:12 <Dot`> i actually know nothing about 2nd ed really, i know some 1st due to horror stories, and i played a bit of 3rd
20:44:21 <Dot`> hmm
20:44:51 <Dot`> cane is your best bet i think, he played baldurs gate a lot if i recall
20:45:16 <Golly> oh, cool
