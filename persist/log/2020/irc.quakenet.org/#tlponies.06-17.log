20:35:43 <Bio> I got this shit called keratoconus, basically my cornea in the right eye is thinning, which is making it warp forward and out more
20:36:02 <Bio> so everything looks like underwater in that eye
20:36:44 <Bio> luckily combined with the other eye i can read and see just fine
20:36:54 <Bio> but i can tell its giving me some srs eye strain 
20:37:28 <skram> but now they gon fix it for good, ya?
20:37:37 <Bio> kinda
20:37:50 <Bio> its supposed to stop it from getting any worse
20:38:02 <Bio> which would then allow for a contact to be prescribed
20:38:08 <skram> excellent
20:38:30 <Bio> there isn't really a cure for it aside from total corneal replacement
20:38:41 <skram> i think they also can transplant corneas or whatever
20:38:50 <Bio> yeh
20:39:09 <skram> does that mean they come from dead people or can you use like horse corneas
20:39:10 <Bio> but i've read that its basically a coin-flip if the eye even takes it
20:39:20 <Bio> full on cadavers
20:39:26 <skram> thats always a risk with transplants i think
20:39:48 <Bio> most likely
20:40:10 <skram> hey
20:40:21 <skram> does that mean you need your brand after this

22:23:07 <Dot`> hows you
22:24:24 <Runbunny> I guess?
22:24:47 <skram> do you doubt me, runbun
22:24:58 <skram> my legs are kinda sore Dot`
22:25:02 <skram> i should use them less
22:25:15 <Dot`> did you go for a jog?
22:25:36 <skram> no, ive just been on my legs doing stuff all week
22:26:52 <skram> i used a machine to shred dirt on monday and that was bloody exhausting
22:27:18 <skram> apparently its called a tiller
22:28:05 <Dot`> hmm
22:28:28 <Runbunny> Nah
22:28:35 <Runbunny> but again it's very hot :/
22:29:06 <skram> just get nekkid, pal
22:39:24 <Dot`> thats your solution to many things skram
22:39:56 <skram> true
22:40:06 <skram> and i dont really have that many problems these days
22:40:09 <skram> coincidence? i think not
22:41:32 <Dot`> if only it fixed migraines
22:41:55 <skram> ah, well
22:42:16 <skram> Helps taking your hat off at least
22:43:37 <skram> did you go to the pharmacy to get The Good Drugs yet, Dot`?
22:45:13 <reification> night all
22:45:18 <skram> gnight reifen
22:45:28 <Dot`> nah, ill forgot all about it till in a few months where i get another migraine
22:45:31 <Dot`> Gnight reif <3
22:45:41 <skram> dot pls
22:45:52 <skram> trust your good pal skrammen
22:51:05 <Camail> work done, relax time, woo
22:51:17 <skram> are you still doing PoE
22:52:15 <Camail> yea, i know what build i'm doing, did practice runs of it, now i just need to steal a passive tree
22:53:18 <skram> whats the new cool thing this season
22:54:55 <DuB`> I should go look at more builds
22:54:57 <DuB`> I wanna flashy
22:55:23 <Dot`> i think one more season break then i may try PoE again
22:59:09 <Camail> wel...this league had a lot of nerfs
22:59:11 <Camail> mostly nerfs
22:59:15 <Camail> i'd say 95% nerfs
22:59:38 <Camail> the hotness is currently the only build that wasnt nerfed, volatile dead spellslinger
23:00:11 <Camail> DuB` if you want interactive and new, warcries are super tryhard but there's literally no build for that yet
23:00:15 <Camail> cuz they just changed
23:00:27 <Camail> but thats big melee not spells
23:01:11 <Camail> ball lightning mines, enki's arc witch, vd spellslinger, these are the options that come to mind for spells
23:01:17 <Camail> magma orb probably
23:01:27 <Camail> i only recommend enki's because the guide is 10/10
23:10:40 <Runbunny> Here you go Jonas https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iwQpPD-GYY
23:12:28 <Runbunny> Also sleep.

23:16:24 <Dot`> skram,panic
23:16:56 <skram> Runbun is like a cranky old housecat, Dot`
23:17:02 <skram> he'll come back when he's hungry
23:17:10 <Dot`> and throw up on the carpet?
23:17:19 <skram> hopefully with a dead rodent
