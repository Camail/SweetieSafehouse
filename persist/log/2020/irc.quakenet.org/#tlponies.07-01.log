20:02:36 <Dot`> dub dub
20:03:15 <DuB`> :o
20:04:54 <Micen|droid2> Dot or reif, how much do jaffa cakes cost over there. I'm curious how much I just over payed. 
20:06:36 <reification> at my supermarket currently about $1 for pack of 10
20:07:05 <reification> or you can get 3 packs for $2
20:07:28 <Micen|droid2> Okay. Import fees are nuts. 
20:07:45 <Micen|droid2> $5 usd for ten. 
20:07:54 <Micen|droid2> But it's worth it as a treat.
20:10:52 <Micen|droid2> I also don't think people understand the point of face asks around me. 
20:11:24 <Micen|droid2> I have seen so many people "wearing" face asks by having their mouths exposed and the mask tucked under their chin. 
20:15:06 <Runbunny> Dot`, Dot` !
20:17:38 <Dot`> Runbun
20:19:30 <Runbunny> Hob's on.
20:22:23 <Dot`> the hob
20:22:33 <reification> that's a new one micen, i've seen plenty of not covering the nose but not that
20:23:02 <reification> i can only assume they think it is some kind of magical repellent 
20:30:39 <Micen|droid2> Indeed. 
20:36:20 <skram> did you decide what kind of cake you're gonna make for your bithday yet dot
20:38:41 <Dot`> no, any suggestions
20:39:38 <skram> chocolate pizza
20:39:51 <skram> it looks terrible but i dont know anyone whos had it and i want to know what its like
20:45:47 <Dot`> thanks
20:47:29 <skram> no probs
20:52:27 <Micen|droid2> I've had cherry pizza. Which i suppose was just a tart shaped like a thin crust pizza. 
20:53:15 <Micen|droid2> I think I had chocolate once as well. But do you mean like chocolate on cheese and red sauce? 
20:53:55 <skram> its just pizza shaped but with chocolate on it i think
20:54:04 <Micen|droid2> Now Im thinking. Make a red sauce from cherries, use cream cheese and dyed white chocolate coins as "pepperoni" 
20:54:23 <Micen|droid2> Maybe mint if you like greens on pizza. 
20:54:48 <Micen|droid2> Now I want to try to make fancy desert pizza. 
20:55:01 <skram> you should
20:55:07 <skram> and then document your journey
20:55:25 <Micen|droid2> But all those ingredients are expensive. 
20:56:01 <Micen|droid2> Mostly because I would have to make my chocolate coins by hand. Because the coins I can get are low quality. 
20:56:15 <skram> kickstarter!

22:31:21 <Micen|Droid> I guess so. 
22:31:23 <Bio> yes
22:31:27 <DuB`> As long as you have a candle on tops
22:31:33 <Micen|Droid> If the one who's birthday it is wants brownies. 
22:31:33 <skram> Well, obviously
22:32:03 <skram> is number-shaped candles acceptable or do you need the exact number of single candles
22:32:40 <DuB`> Both are good
22:32:47 <DuB`> Hard to fit 120 candles on a brownie
22:34:51 <Runbunny> Get a big brownie ;)
