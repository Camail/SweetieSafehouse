00:06:13 <Dot`> Dub, you get all the excels fixed?
00:06:48 <DuB`> Yes
00:06:54 <DuB`> And the powerpoint too!
00:06:59 <Runbunny> Nice!
00:07:06 <Dot`> !!!
00:07:10 <Runbunny> I guess it's late.
00:07:13 <Runbunny> I'll go sleep.
00:07:15 <Runbunny> Goodnight.
00:07:41 <DuB`> Aw
00:07:47 <DuB`> Sleepsbun 
00:07:56 <Runbunny> :3
00:13:28 <Dot`> aww missed him :(
00:16:27 <Dot`> i wanted to tell him Hob is 4 games in
00:16:35 <Dot`> 4 games complete*
00:18:19 <DuB`> Ooh
00:21:21 <Dot`> nope, he updated the board wrong, he is 3 games complete
00:21:27 <Dot`> still pretty good though
00:26:46 <Dot`> you all ready for DnD tomrow dub? going to kill theh dragon, get the gold and finish the campagn
00:27:22 <DuB`> Of course
00:33:12 <Dot`> great
00:45:49 <Camail> spoilers: he is not ready and will die
00:45:54 <Camail> which is an ending either way
00:46:18 <Camail> dub is obligated to die in every campaign 
00:46:34 <DuB`> You may be thinking of TTS
00:46:46 <DuB`> I have only died once in DnD, and it was YOUR FAULT! :P
00:46:49 <Camail> dnd is a table top simulated game
00:46:57 <Camail> dont get hit, scrub
00:48:13 <Camail> i enjoyed that side quest. failed lich transformations are a neat concept
00:48:18 <DuB`> Yes this is why I play birb ranger now, can't get hit 80 feet away from the fight behind a tree 50 feet up
00:48:35 <Camail> if i dm again i'm gonna clip your wings
00:48:50 <Camail> call you NuB
00:48:57 <DuB`> D:
00:49:02 <Camail> :)
00:49:15 <Dot`> i semi tpked the party once, dub got away, and killed 1 character last session, once again not dub
00:49:20 <Dot`> i feel like im failing
00:49:34 <Camail> hmmm.... i mean, its all dubs fault tho, right
00:49:44 <DuB`> I clicked accept.
00:49:51 <Camail> i doubt that
00:51:22 <Camail> i had a double decker bologna/salami/potato chip sandwich and i think i can feel my body turning into a statue
00:51:36 <Camail> i might not make it
00:51:42 <Camail> i feel like i've done this before
00:51:48 <Camail> skram  why didnt you stop me this time

00:54:43 <Dot`> F
00:55:01 <DuB`> He died at Smough last time I watched so I wanted to see if he'd get past that
00:55:14 <Dot`> Dub curse
00:58:17 <Camail> carbs are great if your a physically active person
00:58:22 <Camail> i happen to not be
00:58:34 <Dot`> time to do some push ups
00:58:36 <Camail> but carbs being seen as the devil is just silly
00:58:41 <Camail> 1. fuck you
00:58:42 <Camail> 2. no
00:58:59 <Dot`> your activly mean
00:59:15 <Camail> the blood has gone out of my muscles and into my stomach to try and digest this 13th task of hercules
01:00:00 <Camail> i am reactively mean
01:00:35 <DuB`> The "eat so much your body can't absord it, and has to work overtime to process it" diet
01:02:06 <Camail> its friday so i treated myself 
01:02:38 <Camail> i mostly enjoyed it, make next time chips on the side cuz it got too tall
