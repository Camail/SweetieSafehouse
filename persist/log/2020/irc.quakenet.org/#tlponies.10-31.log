00:18:07 <reification> dub this is how i imagine new york https://www.thecut.com/2020/10/sinkhole-opens-in-nyc-sidewalk-plunging-man-into-rat-pit.html
00:18:56 <reification> did you see we are going to get a lockdown sequel dotties?
00:19:24 <Dot`> oh? i saw many ppl where in tier 3
00:19:46 <reification> this is clearly in response to me trying to make plans today D:
00:20:37 <Dot`> why would you tempt fate
00:20:50 <Dot`> also is there a date for this new lockdown?
00:23:34 <DuB`> I've seen a grand total of 2 rats in the last year, reification, both down in the subway tracks
00:24:36 <DuB`> Apparently I haven't found enough sidewalk death holes
00:46:03 <reification> no dot, it just that current levels are 4 times what they thought were worst case scenarios
00:46:28 <Dot`> because ppl are dumb
01:03:44 <reification> iirc if you ask ppl to give 99% confidence interval prediction it actually covers 50% of the results
01:04:01 <reification> anyway i got the mercy skin :D
01:04:03 <reification> night all
01:04:44 <DuB`> nn reif
