02:01:43 <Camail> Dot` benefit of having the center town: big dollars from tariffs- detriment: people seem to think THEY should own it instead of me =/
02:02:05 <Camail> and none of my lords like me very much so they wont die for me!
02:02:45 <Camail> also playing a woman is a pain in the ass, no one wants to be a stay at home dad
