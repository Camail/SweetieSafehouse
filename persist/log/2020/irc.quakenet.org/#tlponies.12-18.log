18:20:03 <Dot|Phone> What was it like to have third world Internet skram
18:20:51 <skram> Think its better to have no internet than slow internet
18:25:17 <Runbunny> Yes.
18:49:06 <Camail> so i found my favorite thing to do in cyberpunk is to ramp my bike into a crowd of enemies, jump off, then slice slice
18:49:25 <Camail> i have been skipping all quests and just running around melting everything
18:49:34 <skram> murderhobo
18:49:35 <Camail> the single target damage is absolutely insane
18:49:52 <Camail> wtf dota pit
18:49:56 <Camail> just stay live ffs
18:50:25 <skram> did you do the hidden endings yet Camail
18:50:38 <Camail> i'm only aware of the 4 endings
18:50:45 <skram> oh
18:52:53 <Camail> there appears to be only one secret ending that i can see
18:53:38 <Camail> i've only done my one ending on my first playthrough, i'm not one to reload and do multiple
18:53:59 <skram> I wasnt happy with the one I chose so I had to try again
18:54:23 <Camail> did you go with hanako
18:54:28 <skram> first yes
18:54:50 <Camail> then you went with nomads
18:55:01 <skram> correct
18:55:29 <skram> which i think is the best ending 
18:55:35 <Camail> the one thing they failed to do in this game is get me to not dislike johnny
18:55:48 <Camail> i like him as a character
18:55:51 <Camail> but he's a douche canoe
18:56:01 <Camail> and they didnt make him sympathetic enough
18:56:51 <skram> hmm
18:57:07 <Camail> thats why i didnt go the silverhand route and went nomads
18:57:14 <skram> he did become a bit softer after doing his sidequests
18:57:14 <Camail> because fuck you its mine
18:57:31 <skram> what do you mean
18:57:42 <skram> johnny had nothing to do with the nomad end tbh
18:57:44 <Camail> didnt do it enough, i didnt care what the engram was doing while the chip was literally eating me
18:58:01 <Camail> yes, thats why i did the nomad end instead of silverhand
18:58:08 <Camail> arasaka was obviously a bad choise
18:58:12 <skram> right yes
18:58:12 <Camail> so i weighed between those
18:59:39 <Camail> the secret ending would be pretty easy,t he only thing that kills me now is accidentally slashing an exploding barrel and instantly dying
19:00:26 <skram> do you have the ninja swordz
19:00:38 <Camail> i have a katana for the crit chance, yes
19:00:50 <Camail> and i have a button that makes everything 1/4th speed
19:00:55 <skram> oooh
19:01:16 <Camail> doing stupid damage, with insane uptime
19:01:36 <Camail> clearing a room in like 4 seconds, its actually pretty fun
19:01:57 <Camail> i have 80% crit chance, which is nice
19:02:11 <Camail> once i get cold blood on crit the build is basically bullet proof
19:02:37 <Camail> this second palythrough i managed to get max street cred in 20 hours
19:02:38 <skram> I feel like I didnt do enough shooting in this game
19:02:45 <skram> cleared most missions with stealth
19:02:52 <Camail> i felt the opposite, so i started a 2nd dude
19:03:03 <Camail> oh, stealth
19:03:09 <Camail> yea i did a decent amount of stealth
19:03:15 <Camail> but like, its the skyrim effect
19:03:20 <Camail> stealth archer is the easiest way to play
19:03:32 <Camail> so most people take the path of least resistance 
19:03:45 <Camail> you have to make an effort to play differently
19:04:15 <skram> Maybe, though I feel like sneaking around is more difficult than just shooting things in the face
19:04:20 <skram> at this difficulty level anyway
19:04:24 <skram> normal or whatever
19:04:25 <Camail> not on very hard
19:04:33 <skram> thats probably true
19:04:43 <Camail> i've only played it on very hard so i wouldnt know
19:05:07 <Camail> sneaking is significantly easier because you get 3 hits and you're dead
19:05:17 <Camail> most snipers 1 hit kill you if you arent scaling armor
19:05:53 <Camail> but in general the game isnt hard enough
19:06:08 <Camail> the ending was laughably easy with quickhacks and i assume it will be even easier with swords
19:07:04 <skram> I didnt mind the difficulty for most of it but the end was too easy, agreed
19:07:42 <skram> like you're trying to murderize two of the biggest megacorps with a bunch of rednecks, it should be a bit desperate
19:09:40 <skram> adam smasher was kinda tricky if only for his massive hp pool
19:09:45 <skram> probably hits harder on nightmare
19:09:56 <Camail> i stun locked him with quickhacks
19:10:03 <Camail> just sat there and shot him
19:10:07 <skram> rude
19:10:19 <Camail> he died out of reach, so iw as having dialog off a balcony
19:10:24 <Camail> and could barely see him
19:18:29 <Camail> oh skram did you got nethack or voodoo
19:20:07 <skram> no?
19:20:33 <skram> whats that
19:30:38 <Camail> oh, typos. i meant eho did you choose between the two
19:30:44 <Camail> who.
19:31:18 <Camail> well, choose between trusting vs not trusting voodoo, i should say
19:31:44 <Camail> i went voodoo so i dunno how far the net police thing actually goes
19:31:51 <Camail> maybe its not called nethack i forget
19:32:08 <skram> im not sure what you're referring to tbh
19:32:17 <skram> do you mean the people in pacifica?
19:32:25 <Camail> yes, the voodoo boys
19:32:28 <skram> aaah yeah
19:32:32 <skram> naw dont trust em
19:32:40 <skram> not sure if it matters either
19:34:10 <Camail> man, the voodoo boys are easily the least likeable faction
19:34:40 <Camail> like, extremist, isolationist, misanthropic to the extreme
19:34:41 <skram> they're pretty cool but they tried to kill you
19:35:02 <Camail> well, when they tell you why they started this whole GAME, its for a fucked up reason
19:35:14 <skram> true
19:35:26 <skram> nomads are easily the most likeable faction
19:36:42 <Camail> i wish the mox were more present
19:36:54 <Camail> you can talk to the leader once but then nothing
19:36:58 <Camail> maybe later
19:40:01 <skram> who'd you romance
19:40:22 <Camail> well i played as a woman, and the only option is judy
19:40:27 <Camail> the only. option.
19:40:53 <Camail> i dont date people who's name is an object
19:41:13 <skram> true
19:41:34 <Camail> but judy was by far the most interesting person
19:41:45 <Camail> the most faceted character, interesting quest line
19:41:57 <Camail> really good romance ending, and it fit perfectly with the nomad ending
19:43:00 <Camail> going panam this time because well, only option
19:43:15 <Camail> she's cool, but she talks funny
19:43:20 <skram> hah
19:43:23 <Camail> feels like anon english speaker wrote her dialog 
19:43:25 <skram> well she is a redneck
19:43:30 <Camail> no, she speaks proper
19:43:37 <Camail> like, fairly formal
19:43:41 <skram> is panam the only romance option for boy V
19:43:50 <Camail> unless river is bi, probably
19:44:21 <Camail> panam doesn't use contractions, ever
19:44:44 <Camail> every time i hits me
19:44:46 <Camail> it*
19:45:21 <skram> i never noticed that
19:45:55 <Camail> yea its why i'm thinking her writer specifically just had a weird quirk when they learned english
19:46:01 <Camail> none of the nomads talk like her
