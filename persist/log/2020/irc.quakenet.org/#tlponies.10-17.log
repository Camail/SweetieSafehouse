01:06:44 <Dot|Phone> Skram how hades going
01:07:35 <skrma> im bad at it so i took a break
01:07:50 <Dot|Phone> Game is hard
01:07:51 <skrma> its pretty good though
01:08:17 <Dot|Phone> How far you get? 
01:08:31 <skrma> first boss
01:08:33 <skrma> megara
01:08:47 <Dot|Phone> Ah. Great voice 
01:10:20 <Dot|Phone> Tip: reduce her health bar to 0 to win
01:10:28 <skrma> oh i see
01:10:30 <skrma> very helpful tip
01:11:59 <Dot|Phone> If you need any more help feel free to ask
01:27:26 <DuB`> Looks fun but rougelikes make me the sad 
01:27:27 <DuB`> :P
01:30:26 <Camail> hades runs are around 30 minutes
01:30:33 <Camail> for like a full run
01:30:48 <Camail> it can take 5-10 minutes to reach the first boss
01:31:20 <Camail> and you get SO MANY resources when you keep repeating bosses without beating the game
01:31:50 <Camail> going on win streaks is actually bad if you are grinding certain things
01:33:14 <DuB`> Hm
01:33:17 <DuB`> I'll try it
01:34:00 <Camail> i treat it like darksouls
01:34:18 <Camail> though since i played before 1.0, the third area got harder
01:37:52 <skrma> i got god mode on so at some point im gonna be a winner
01:37:52 <skrma> maybe
01:39:40 <Camail> oh
01:41:04 <Camail> that's a neat mechanic
01:41:15 <Camail> it certainly helps if all you care about is the story
01:56:09 <DuB`> Hmm controller or mkb
02:28:27 <Camail> i use controller
02:29:02 <Camail> wasd doesnt do well with games like this
02:30:50 <Camail> and the auto-aim for ranged weapons is generous

17:18:33 <Camail> no
17:19:10 <Dot|Phone> Why
17:23:04 <Camail> cuz
17:31:19 <reify> dot https://twitter.com/aucklandzoo/status/1315804535726669825/photo/1
17:38:39 <Dot`> this is great news reif
17:43:38 <Dot`> cam, i saw the cupcake episode in crit role today
17:43:55 <Micen> bout time dot.
17:44:07 <Dot`> im only like 10 months behind
17:44:47 <Micen> that including the 5 months of off time the cast took due to covid?
17:45:41 <Dot`> i guess 
17:47:45 <Camail> yea thats a top 3 moments in cr
17:48:04 <Camail> that, The Counterspell, and something that happened recently
17:49:00 <Micen> Grog vs the Herd in C1 floats in and out for me as top three moment as well 
17:49:41 <Camail> yea him getting the kamikaze was pretty good
17:50:36 <Micen> and it felt as equally character important as the cupcake.  its hard. the best moments all stick out together 
17:52:07 <Camail> i dont think anything touches the cupcake for me, gros desperate lucky roll was really cool for the story, but the cupcake was like... seeing an entire character distilled into one brilliant action
17:52:25 <Camail> matt even said that its what pushed him over to go with the next arc for her
17:52:35 <Camail> grog*
17:53:16 <Camail> but they're all quite good, top 3 is a bit too restrictive, even
17:53:35 <Camail> like the start of the chroma conclave was amazing, the timing was perfect
17:53:50 <Camail> the group was JUST about to start drifting apart
17:54:40 <Camail> and i think this campaign 2 is gonna end in a few months
17:55:34 <Micen> I can see that 
17:56:10 <Camail> it needs to end before jester completely takes over laura's brain
17:56:20 <Camail> and she'll be lost forever
17:57:56 <Camail> was reminded of one more really good moment, when vax went after the briarwoods and jenga'd so hard i think he died?
17:58:49 <Camail> that was also the start of the best c1 arc
17:58:57 <Camail> or when he dropped that acid on his party, also good
18:01:59 <Micen> so many good moments.  I tihnk i need to watch C1 again 
18:50:37 <Dot`> Runbunny, you think hob will do it today?
18:55:28 <Camail> all signs point to no
18:56:30 <Dot`> its true
18:57:49 <Runbunny> I hope that he'll try his best.
18:58:14 <Runbunny> Overcome his mental blocks and transcend.
19:03:17 <Golly> hm i bought a mango flavor monster can, but the contents are orange flavor
19:03:21 <Golly> this is the worst
19:04:41 <Golly> well it would be anyway if I didnt also like orange
19:07:40 <Runbunny> That is unfortunate.
