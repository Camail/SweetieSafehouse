12:49:38 <skram> hows work
12:51:12 <Dot|Phone> Hmm. Doing ok I guess
13:00:02 <carcinisation> runbunny actually it came from here which is a pretty useful summary of the case for artificial origin https://harvardtothebighouse.com/2020/01/31/logistical-and-technical-analysis-of-the-origins-of-the-wuhan-coronavirus-2019-ncov/
13:19:19 <Runbunny> It's still mostly speculation though. Interesting none the less.
13:20:02 <carcinisation> yeah it's gonna be unclear for a while at least unless we get a confession or the like
