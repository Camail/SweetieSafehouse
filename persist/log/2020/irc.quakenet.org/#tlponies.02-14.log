18:55:08 <Camail> how has your friday been
18:55:17 <Camail> are you ready to go clubbing tonight
19:11:16 <Dot`> no seals left in skelmanthorpe
19:16:46 <skrma> no dot he's talking about gettin' FUCKED UPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
19:17:14 <Dot`> im playing tarkov later, those high level players alwasy fuck me up
19:17:34 <skrma> no lets do drugs in the bathroom
19:19:38 <Dot`> i keep my drugs in my desk drawer
19:20:24 <BioPhone> Asdf
19:20:31 <BioPhone> Slow work is slow
19:21:35 <skrma> just go home bio
19:21:41 <skrma> do burnouts in front of the lobby
19:24:01 <Dot`> doughnuts
19:24:01 <Camail> lets set fire to the government buildings
19:24:03 <Camail> all of them
19:24:13 <Camail> burn the staaaaaate
19:24:58 <Dot`> cammamail, how did your warband game go? did you become king of all butts?
19:26:13 <Camail> last i played i went to war and while i was busy taking a castle my other lords took a city, so that was neat
19:26:36 <Camail> i haven't played in a bit, poe private league and hades have filled my game times
19:27:43 <Dot`> i die to the bull and his friend 
19:28:12 <Camail> ah, there's a trick to that
19:28:21 <Camail> the mino is super fast and theseus is super slow
19:28:38 <Camail> so you can easily separate them and fight the mino behind pillars, ignoring the spears
19:29:36 <Camail> fun game, also kinda cooling down on it
19:30:01 <Camail> found two builds i like, can consistently beat the game with them. but i dont enjoy the other weapons much
19:30:44 <Camail> they're gonna have to nerf the sword aspect that buffs your casts, its pretty broken
19:30:52 <Dot`> well nice thing update in 26 days
19:31:15 <Camail> i kinda wanna wait until it's finished
19:31:23 <Camail> adding demeter is super cool
19:31:32 <Camail> grandma is cranky
19:31:47 <Camail> i wodner how this game plays for people who dont know greek mythology 
19:32:49 <Camail> playing a game that's in the middle of a famous myth is pretty neat
19:36:04 <Dot`> im rusty on my greek mythology
19:36:23 <Dot`> mostly its from titan quest at this point probably
19:38:43 <Dot`> beyond the populour stuff i guess i dont know much really
19:39:54 <Dot`> did you ever see this cam? https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/arcanumworlds/odyssey-of-the-dragonlords-5th-edition-adventure-b
19:40:00 <Dot`> i think ive linked it before ages ago
19:40:15 <Camail> i have not
19:41:02 <Camail> looks very comprehensive
19:41:38 <Dot`> its greek myth AND linked to Kotor, suprised i didnt ping you
19:43:25 <Camail> i want darth revan in there
19:43:30 <Camail> make them a god
19:44:21 <Dot`> and some fish ppl with silly voices

20:37:59 <Camail> Dot`  i'm "trying" wolcen the new action rpg, if it's good i'll let you know
20:38:14 <Dot`> gl!
20:38:31 <Dot`> i grabbed kingdom come deliverance on epic as its free atm
20:39:02 <Camail> oooh
20:39:07 <Camail> i enjoyed that game a lot, actually
20:39:24 <Camail> you legit start out as like, a garbage can
20:39:32 <Camail> everything you do is bad because you suck at everything
20:39:50 <Camail> but then you get better
20:39:55 <Dot`> lol
20:40:00 <Camail> you might want to install some mods tho
20:40:06 <Camail> because in the base game you cant really...save
20:40:40 <Camail> i didnt have an issue with it, but it kinda forces a more try-hard approach if you dont mod in saves
20:41:49 <Dot`> hmm
20:43:23 <Camail> two ways to save, sleeping in a bed or drinking a save potion
20:43:39 <Camail> and it takes a bit to get the potions
20:43:53 <Camail> and then takes a bit longer to reliably  make them so you can save like a normal person
20:58:03 <Dot`> that seems unecesarily painful

23:47:36 -!- Rawr|Fone [~AndChat52@c-94cfe455.020-164-6d6c6d4.bbcust.telenor.se] has joined #tlponies
23:47:43 <skram> :O
23:47:45 <skram> was it a bad job
23:48:56 <Rial> If anyone wants, there's a "Content Writer" position that pays $15 for writing youtube scripts, and some editing, for their products for streamers and content creators
23:49:22 <Rial> I feel the job was too "Here's how to use your products. Buy them!" -- I'm non interested in being a salesperson
23:50:00 <skram> a whole 15$!
23:50:42 <skram> you'd have to write one script per hour to get a proper wage
23:51:50 <Rial> Yeah... at least from a freelancer perspective, considering all the taxes, and everything, I'd need to get something around $27 at least. But like... in Japan, most non specialized jobs only pay 900 yen. That's about 8.5 USD/hour
23:52:34 <skram> hmm
23:53:02 <skram> how much would you need per hour assuming a 40 hour work week to live not in poverty in japan?
23:54:21 <Rial> Poverty line is defined at 160,000 from a 2016 (I think) census. so that would be... 1000 yen per hour on a full 8 hour job with weekends off
23:54:59 <Dot`> depends what you consider poverty i guess
23:55:14 <Runbunny> That's 2/3 of what the lowest allowed pay is for adults in Denmark.
23:55:19 <Rial> https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Poverty_in_Japan
23:55:23 <skram> well theres usually a defined poverty limit
23:55:48 <Runbunny> I vaguely seem to recall that Japan doesn't have one.
23:55:50 <skram> in norway its about 32k usd
23:55:57 <Rial> I wonder where I read the number 160,000 yen
