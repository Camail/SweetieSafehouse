20:30:06 <Runbunny> Hob cracks me up so much.
20:30:19 <Runbunny> The brbs are hilarious.
20:33:47 <Dot`> good stuff
20:37:58 <skram> whats for dinner today Dot`
20:40:40 <Dot`> some lentil bugers, caulslaw and potatoe wedges
20:40:55 <Dot`> being back in backwell means i dont do my own cooking
20:41:17 <Dot`> so i eat more than microwaved rice and whatever goes in the ove for 30 minutes
20:42:29 <Runbunny> Nice.
20:44:30 <Dot`> what about you skram
20:44:57 <Dot`> runbun, hows the CSGO practice?
20:47:35 <reification> lentil burgers aren't real dot
20:48:01 <Dot`> it was something burgers
20:48:07 <Dot`> i dont really question it
20:48:58 <reification> burgers are only meat, anything else is a cruel hoax
20:49:31 <Runbunny> Haven't practiced today. However I did play some fps game.
20:49:41 <Dot`> patty shaped squashed stuff reif
20:49:56 <Runbunny> Reif, I can't roll the cat girl idol :(
20:50:21 <Dot`> RIP hob
20:50:22 <reification> oh no runbun. that is very sad :(
20:50:46 <Dot`> runbun you should start multiple account
20:50:47 <reification> i had to buy her summer skin
20:51:18 <skram> i havent had any yet Dot`
20:51:21 <skram> so i was lookin for tips
20:51:24 <reification> you are supposed to help him escape dot, not push him further in :O
20:51:41 <Runbunny> I am far too deep in all kinds of stuff at this point.
20:52:12 <Runbunny> I could buy sora for distinctions though.
20:52:14 <Dot`> Well skram i advise macaroni cheese with at least 3 cheese 
20:52:18 <Dot`> and a hint of mustard
20:52:24 <reification> and bacon
20:52:28 <Dot`> yes
20:52:39 <Runbunny> Also poor Hob.
20:53:50 <reification> sora's kit is unique bun. skill one is basically naga siren aghs
20:57:54 <Runbunny> I also didn't roll Schwarz :/
20:58:11 <reification> me neither
20:58:36 <DuB`> I did :D
20:58:49 <reification> beginners luck :p
20:58:52 <Runbunny> Look at this guy.
20:58:56 <DuB`> Also hoshiguma
20:59:19 <reification> slice 'em all with that shield
20:59:34 <Runbunny> I only have 1 six star actually.
20:59:38 <Dot`> Dub getting good rolls??? never heard of it
20:59:44 <DuB`> ;D
20:59:46 <DuB`> .choose margherita formaggi
21:00:07 <Runbunny> He's unstoppable, this Dub guy.
21:00:24 <reification> game literally guarantees you a 6star in first 20 rolls dot
21:00:47 <Runbunny> Guess I'll just buy Sora.
21:01:05 <reification> even after that the longer you go without rolling one the more it jacks up the chance
21:02:35 <Dot`> so reif, your saying the games rigged?
21:05:39 <Runbunny> Yes.
21:06:00 <Runbunny> I don't have Dub on my friend list.
21:06:03 <Runbunny> Rigged.
21:10:59 <Dot`> wow dub, are you not friends with runbun
21:19:39 <reification> friends list isn't available until you reach a certain level iirc though?
21:20:18 <reification> i can't believe dub would neglect us

21:48:22 <Dot`> is there going to be a sekiro 2 bun?
21:50:28 <Runbunny> I don't think so.
21:51:01 <Runbunny> From software is currently working on a game called Elden Ring.
21:51:35 <Dot`> i heard mention of that
21:51:49 <Dot`> dont know anything about it, didnt even know it was from dark souls ppl
21:51:54 <Runbunny> and Miyazaki doesn't really like sequels that much. 
21:52:12 <Dot`> thats why there is 3 Dark souls
21:54:20 <Runbunny> Well Miyazaki wasn't much involved in Dark souls 2. 
21:55:23 <Runbunny> He probably got roped into doing dark souls 3.
21:58:58 <Runbunny> It's just too bad that there will never be a pc bloodborne.
21:59:24 <Runbunny> Unless you do that playstation network thing so you can play playstation games on your pc.
