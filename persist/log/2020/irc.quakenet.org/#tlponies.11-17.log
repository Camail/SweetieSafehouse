15:45:03 <Runbunny> I was alright.
15:46:56 <Runbunny> We got the trouble we had sorted (at least the part I was involved with)
15:47:26 <Runbunny> But you know how it is. Tomorrow is again full of new troubles for me to deal with.
15:47:27 <skram> dont go causing no mischief ranban
15:47:46 <skram> danmark seems rough these days though
15:48:08 <skram> what with the bird flu and the plague minks
15:49:41 <Runbunny> I think I only solved stuff today. Didn't cause any.
15:49:49 <Runbunny> But that could change tomorrow.
15:50:01 <Runbunny> We're currently the only country with bird flu right?
15:50:04 <Golly> i think that violates the laws of thermodynamics
15:50:09 <skram> afaik
15:50:23 <Cane> Lisa, in this house we obey the rules of thermodynamics!

17:11:10 <Dot`> and by that i mean a solid afrikaaner who was in the special forces for 10 years
17:11:40 <Golly> was he by any chance a sniper
17:13:43 <Dot`> i didnt pry, he carries a large knife
17:13:58 <Golly> ah yes, the poop knife
