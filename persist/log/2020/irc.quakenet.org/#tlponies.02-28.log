01:03:51 <Runbunny> Jonas.
01:04:03 <skram> Hi there.
01:04:44 <Runbunny> I am writing a application for a job in the middle of the night since I have a review of said application in like 8-9 hours.
01:04:57 <skram> you can do it
01:04:58 <Runbunny> and it's litterally the hardest thing ever.
01:05:08 <skram> do you want me to be your reference
01:05:16 <Runbunny> Like, your dick doesn't even compare.
01:05:31 <Runbunny> I kinda want this job O:
01:05:38 <skram> anders drenge er lige en riktigt godt gut
01:05:44 <skram> signed, skram
01:05:49 <Runbunny> :D
01:06:17 <Runbunny> You could add a line about genes and stuff.
01:06:32 <skram> he also did experiments on rats or something
01:09:14 <Bio> this bun is a very good horse - Bio
01:09:21 <Bio> 10/10 would hire
01:10:24 <Runbunny> Given my license I am allowed to: design procedures to be done on laboratory animals, do said procedures provided they fall within the bounds of the legislation, Euthanize animals.
01:10:28 <Runbunny> However.
01:10:41 <Runbunny> I am not allowed to care for them.
01:25:00 <skram> so you're allowed to kill peoples pets but not love them
01:25:09 <skram> how sad
01:27:22 <Runbunny> Basically. 
01:28:54 <Runbunny> Every project involving animal models are required to have a veterinarian to care for the animals.

15:50:29 <BioPone> What pizza did u buy today sir
15:52:06 <Dot`> a spicy one with some salami on it, nothing fancy
15:52:17 <Dot`> and its raining so im not going to go buy olives for it
15:53:13 <Dot`> what about you sir?
15:53:34 <skram> why cant you eat olives in rainy weather
15:56:59 <Dot`> i have to go to the shops to get olives
15:57:16 <skram> oh lol
16:06:05 <BioPone> I'm still at werk, I have some time to mull it over
16:06:21 <BioPone> I don't usually put vegetables on tho
16:21:55 <Runbunny> You don't the glory of salad pizza.
16:23:27 <BioPone> It's true. And I probably will keep it that way xd
16:24:06 <Dot`> My mom and i share a birthday, and we alwasy use to drive out to a town called Franschhoek, great pizza place there, i use to get this green pepper, chillie and feta cheese pizza
16:24:25 <Dot`> dont know why i ever picked that one, but it was one of the best pizzas and i got it every year
16:27:18 <Runbunny> Dot, that sounds way too fancy.
16:27:33 <Runbunny> Just get a pizza with salad, dressing and kebab.
16:27:40 <Runbunny> reification, skram https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Icjlhps-tJ0
16:28:56 <Dot`> runbun, one day we will go there together and get one of those pizzas, then you will see

17:36:01 <Golly> sec
17:39:39 <Golly> so they did a deal with epic sooo
17:39:51 <Golly> they did offer the kickstarter people money back at least
17:40:46 <skram> is it an epic exclusive now
17:41:32 <Golly> I think so
17:42:05 <skram> james is an ass
17:42:06 <skram> etc
17:42:36 <Golly> hard to turn down a big bag of cash
