00:35:31 <Camail> i'm playing through the MC mod sevtech
00:35:34 <Camail> it's been pretty fun
00:35:45 <Camail> hella resource intensive because its 740 mods running at once
00:35:51 <Camail> but it's fun

01:02:44 <Camail> y'know...there's a non zero chance i was one of the first people in the US to get covid? my whole family got something after they went to italy for new years
01:02:52 <Camail> i'm not even like 50% sure....
01:03:08 <Camail> but like, every day i think more about it
01:15:12 <DuB`> Oahh, yeah that's a bit crazy :o
01:15:18 <Camail> ok cool, first confirmed cases are end of january
01:15:25 <Camail> so now i'm at like a solid 20%
01:15:49 <Camail> but like, my mother lost taste and smell, and i had one of the worst coughs i've ever had
01:16:12 <Camail> we all had some key symptoms, but still, very small chance
01:19:03 <Camail> well. they did come home like january 13th. which is roughly two weeks before the first case... which is the magic number.
01:19:12 <Camail> hmmmm, oh well, i'll get an anti-body test eventually
01:53:57 <skrm> cam is patient zero
