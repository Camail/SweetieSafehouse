23:06:34 <Runbunny> Golden boy.
23:06:35 <Runbunny> Go.
23:06:47 <reification> i am not going to spoil dub, but it is fine for you
23:06:54 <Runbunny> It's rated gold.
23:07:03 <DuB`> Haha
23:07:06 <reification> that is another good suggestion
23:19:04 <Crisium|2> yes dub
23:19:06 <Crisium|2> play the OW again
23:23:23 <skram> reif it is the best show
23:24:05 <DuB`> Gotta practice my sigma and hazno, Crisium :P
23:24:39 <DuB`> My zarya/dva/pharah career is not so useful now...
23:27:02 <skram> give me tank meta or give me death
23:32:41 <Crisium> ya pretty much
23:32:46 <Crisium> you can still pharah sometimes
23:32:56 <Crisium> but dva might be worst tank in the game
23:35:45 <Runbunny> Think I need to sleep.
