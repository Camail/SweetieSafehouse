13:48:04 <skram> is this how she stole all the piggy banks

14:36:06 <Cane> Oh
14:36:08 <Cane> my god
14:36:10 <Cane> the new Mercedes F1 car.
14:36:12 <Cane> https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ebq8F3ZXsAMfaJv?format=jpg&name=4096x4096
14:36:19 <Cane> Jaw on floor.
14:36:49 <DuB`> Black??
14:36:57 <DuB`> The Silver Arrow is black, hmm
14:40:44 <Cane> Clearly they saw how much success their black marble has had in Marbula E and decided to do it for the rest of their range.
14:41:00 <DuB`> :D
14:43:15 <Cane> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3S5bHEcmeg Still the best Marbula E race in the season.
14:46:46 <BioPhone> Car go vroom
14:47:47 <Cane> That's an F1 car. It goes EEEEEEE.
14:48:02 <skram> good point
14:49:03 <Cane> DuB`, did you ever play the F1 games on PC?
14:49:10 <DuB`> Naw
14:49:15 <Cane> I've heard their career modes are surprisingly robust.
14:49:52 <DuB`> I heard meh things about performance and periphals working properly for one of 'em, worth another look though
14:50:00 <Cane> Aw.
14:50:27 <Cane> Well, peripherals can be fixed, I'm a JoyToKey and UJR wizard.
14:50:35 <Cane> Performance though, that's unfortunate.
14:53:31 <DuB`> F1 2019 has much better reviews than whatever one I was looking at before and is -75% right now, that seems worth
14:58:20 <Cane> Possibly. I've been considering it for a while, just haven't pulled the trigger yet.
