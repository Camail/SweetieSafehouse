00:00:32 <DuB`> Work from home not time off though, so...
00:00:56 <DuB`> Well, the 50gb download and 50gb texture pack will be nice to get started right away at least
00:03:46 <carcinisation> physical media may have its downsides but at least it kept size in check...
00:05:41 <DuB`> 220 Mbps says bring it on

02:04:55 <Camail> ahhh i dropped the saviour
02:05:00 <Camail> once it sells i can buy a headhunter

02:09:18 <Camail> aahh i want it to sell so badly
02:09:39 <Camail> then i get to level a build and get BIG
02:30:16 <Camail> .tell runbunny i bought a headhunter :)
02:30:20 <Camail> klerjglaziweu4ntgp9ae48thjpa9ue5nyl;seui5hynr5sze5y
02:30:26 <Camail> Cane I BOUGHT A HEADHUNTER
02:30:38 <Camail> ahahahaha
02:30:41 <Cane> Freaking well done. <3
02:30:42 <Camail> i'm shaking
02:30:46 <Camail> 105ex
02:30:51 <Camail> time to make a build
02:31:07 <Cane> Any ideas?
02:31:31 <Camail> probably cyclone
02:31:37 <Camail> maybe berserker cyclone
02:31:52 <Camail> a ton of builds opened up with this belt
02:32:07 <DuB`> But is it stylish
02:32:18 <Camail> no model for belts
02:32:28 <Camail> also its a bunch of heads
02:32:32 <DuB`> ew
02:32:39 <Camail> but its the best item in the game
02:32:47 <Camail> literally bar none
02:32:50 <DuB`> You win!
02:32:54 <DuB`> Just in time for iceborne
02:32:58 <Camail> to the point where GGG has internal meetings about it's existence
02:51:09 <Cane> I wonder if they'll ever pull the trigger and remove it.
02:51:33 <Cane> A lot of vets seem to agree that it shouldn't exist.
02:52:42 <Camail> unlikely, chris likes it, neon doesn't
02:52:45 <Camail> both are leads
02:52:57 <Cane> Mm.
02:53:04 <Camail> enough people want it that i dont think they can ever remove it outright
02:53:11 <Camail> nerfing it maybe
02:53:20 <Camail> but their solution so far is to lower the drop rates
02:53:31 <Cane> It's a hell of a final goal for most serious players, too.
02:53:58 <Camail> yea, it's a chase unique
02:54:07 <Camail> a lot of people like that design
