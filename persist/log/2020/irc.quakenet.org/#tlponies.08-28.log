18:16:07 <Dot|Phone> Skrm
18:16:40 <skrm> ye
18:19:12 <DuB`> So my company gives us access to a whole bunch of 3rd party programs/classes/etc and is pushing them right now as a wellness initiative. I went to go browse and immediately saw... a lego engineering class and a fortnite basics / fundamentals class.
18:19:14 <DuB`> waow
18:19:29 <DuB`> (Amongst a million home-workout / yoga / meditation things, of course)
18:19:40 <skrm> do working proffessionals play fortnite??
18:20:01 <DuB`> Some I guess!
18:20:05 <reification> they certainly do play with lego
18:20:12 <DuB`> 362/600 slots reserved in the fortnite one :P
18:23:48 <skrm> wow
18:24:06 <skrm> sign up for the lego engineering though
18:24:39 <DuB`> Oh
18:24:51 <DuB`> I clicked into it and apparently it's in a "kids" category 
18:24:55 <DuB`> Hmph
18:27:43 <DuB`> 50% off Rosetta Stone subscription
18:27:52 <DuB`> I always did want to try learning japanese...
18:28:29 <Dot|Phone> I'm pretty sure that's a dead language dub
18:28:31 <DuB`> Or norsk!
18:30:04 <skrm> should learn one of the swiss languages for when we retire to switzerland
18:32:50 <Dot|Phone> I'm sure he will pick out up in his current job anyway
18:39:20 <skrm> his new york accent needs work though
18:43:35 <DuB`> Can't say "I'm walkin heah" if I'm always at my desk :T
