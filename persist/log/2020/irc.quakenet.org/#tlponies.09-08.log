18:52:55 <skram> i decided to not do that but instead play videogames and do nothing
18:53:37 <skram> one of my pals told me to make a negroni so i went to the liqour store and got campari but it tastes bloody awful
19:01:07 <reification> that is the kind of thing that happens when you listen to people
19:01:10 <Runbunny> Old lady told me that campari and sparkling water is pretty good.
19:01:20 <Runbunny> When I was still working in a store.
