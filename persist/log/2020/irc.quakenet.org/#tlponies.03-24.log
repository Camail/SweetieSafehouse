14:42:59 <Rawr|Fone> But work could be more fun
14:45:11 <Dot`> aww :(
14:47:10 <DuB`> I wouldn't mind work being a little more...
14:47:11 <DuB`> work?
14:49:10 <skram> that sounds awful
14:50:45 <DuB`> It's so awkward just "sort of" having work to do and constantly asking around to make sure there's not more I should stay busy with
14:51:37 <DuB`> Glad I'm home though... if I was stuck in the office with this amount of idle time I'd have gone crazy already
14:53:04 <skram> is it an open office space where they'll definitly notice if you look at cat gifs for 6 hours?
14:53:54 <DuB`> Basically
14:54:21 <skram> thats a problem
14:54:27 <skram> you should get your own office
14:55:00 <DuB`> Just need to skip promotions and go straight to Director, then yes
14:55:15 <DuB`> Who needs 8 years of experience anyway
14:55:59 <skram> you dont need experience if you got moxy
14:56:21 <reify> runbun arknights is down D:
14:57:05 <Zounds> Most of my office is open too
14:57:34 <Zounds> Thankfully I'm tucked away with 4 others in a separate room
14:58:05 <Zounds> The open plan bit is a cacophany I'm glad to dodge it
14:59:05 <skram> even the director at my company sits in the open office

15:34:01 <Camail> hi skram, are you taking better care of yourself yet
15:34:07 <Camail> or still constantly shitting on yourself
15:34:37 <Dot`> skram, thats not quarintine
15:34:44 <skram> i never shit on myself, cam
15:34:47 <skram> thats what you do
15:37:51 <Camail> dub how goes your self isolation? have there been any other positive tests from your building?
15:39:52 <DuB`> Yeah, got emails about a handful of people who were in the building who tested positive recently. Only that first one was directly linked to floors I visited
15:40:47 <Dot`> they all visit the ground floor though
15:42:57 <DuB`> Don't have to touch anything to get from there to a desk
15:43:07 <Zounds> Elevator buttons
15:43:09 <Zounds> you're all doomed
15:43:26 <DuB`> The most potential exposure I've had was probably the subway, not work, and it's been 2 weeks since I've done that now
15:43:35 <Dot`> good
15:44:02 <skram> just use your pp on the elevator buttons Zounds
15:44:04 <skram> crisis averted
15:44:44 <Dot`> do you mean ppe?
15:45:03 <skram> that could also work
15:46:13 <Dot`> well we know how skram got the virus
15:47:11 <skram> im 69% certain it doesnt transmit via pp
15:47:38 <Camail> it can go into your dick hole
15:47:43 <Camail> that's just a science fact
15:48:21 <DuB`> I don't think that's part of the respiratory system in ANY animal
15:49:09 <Camail> a membrane's a membrane
15:49:29 <Camail> if you can take drugs in it, it can get infected
15:51:20 <skram> hmmm
