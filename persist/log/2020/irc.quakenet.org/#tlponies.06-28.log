16:46:23 <Camail> oi
16:46:25 <Rawr|Fone> Good evening camail
16:48:04 <Camail> Dot` i played griftlands, it was very fun
16:48:23 <Camail> almost won on my first attempt, but died on the final boss
16:48:53 <Camail> but one of the endgame options is to redo the last day, and i won then. which isn't quite the same but still fun
16:50:35 <Camail> its like STS with a story, so i am enjoying way more, but for me personally the replayability isn't as high (aka doing 100 runs)
16:57:28 <Dot`> yea, im curious how the replayability would hold, im sure it helps having diffrent characters
16:59:08 <Camail> there are a few persistent choice that make it interesting
18:00:25 <Camail> for the first character there are fairly clear archetypes, each deck has 2 mechanics to choose from
18:01:17 <Camail> negotiation has intimidation or influence. hmm battle has 3, combo, bleed, and wound
18:01:51 <Camail> i was making a combo deck but ended up beating the final boss by getting a lucky wound stack
18:04:44 <Camail> honestly, the biggest difference mechanically is that your basic cards can be upgraded into actually useful cards
