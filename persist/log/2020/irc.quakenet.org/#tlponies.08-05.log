00:37:13 <Runbunny> Kinda, but I haven't done anything about them.

21:35:38 <Camail> no
21:35:50 <skram> fuckin yes, pal
21:36:35 <Camail> i always wished the intro to that song was the entire song
21:37:07 <skram> eh
21:37:15 <skram> this cover is a lot better than the original tbh
21:37:31 <Camail> it just turns into generic nothing
21:37:55 <Camail> the marching band percussion is at least interesting
21:38:18 <Camail> always felt like two different songs entirely
21:39:01 <skram> I do wonder why they brought along those big ass timpanis and then dont use them
21:39:47 <Camail> i'm guessing they were for something else
21:39:59 <skram> they get used a lil bit at the end actually
21:40:02 <skram> cant really hear it tho
21:40:03 <Camail> judging by context, this was part of a bigger project
21:42:24 <Camail> honestly i cant tell much of a difference between the cover and the original, save for the female vocals
21:44:00 <BioSC> yo
21:44:02 <Camail> hmm, listening again, if they just cut out the middle of the song that'd be great
21:44:04 <BioSC> it IS wednesday
21:44:06 <BioSC> my dudes
21:44:37 <skram> what music do you even like cam

21:44:48 <skram> gnight reifen
21:45:04 <Camail> i dont listen to music
21:45:19 <Camail> so i dont gravitate towards any particular genre
21:46:04 <Dot`> gnight reif
21:46:16 <Camail> i like really good rhythm and really good vocals
21:46:17 <Dot`> cam!
21:46:19 <Dot`> hi
21:46:21 <Camail> dot
21:46:26 <Camail> are you real

22:12:15 <Dot`> well DnD went good, apart from TJ's character being unconcious the whole session :/
22:12:26 <skram> silly goat
22:12:28 <BioSC> ez game ez life
22:12:30 <skram> tell him to wake the fuck up
22:12:54 <Dot`> well he died
22:13:04 <Dot`> had to be ressed
22:13:47 <BioSC> poor lad
22:14:00 <skram> unconciousness and death arent the same thing Dot`
22:14:41 <Dot`> well he went unconsious about 20 minutes into the session due to his running though all the enemies and getting seperated from his party
22:14:52 <skram> well that does sound like him
22:14:53 <Dot`> then he passed 2 death saves and failed 3
22:15:01 <Dot`> no one could get to him
22:15:36 <Dot`> I like to think engelbert would have got to him
22:15:54 <BioSC> i mean yeah
22:16:08 <BioSC> the lad is not stoppable when his frins are involved in some shit
22:17:02 <Dot`> i wonder who will get in more trouble, Englbert, Low wisdom otis, or Geoff
22:17:30 <skram> yes
22:17:32 <BioSC> my name geoff
22:17:38 <skram> yeos
22:18:10 <Dot`> skram, we are going to get into a lot of trouble with all 3 of us in one party...
22:18:19 <skram> pfft we'll be fine
22:19:26 <skram> you got the healing stuff and i got a great sword
22:20:46 <Dot`> New improved otis, with 3x the edge, now even more support spells
22:20:58 <skram> edges are good
22:22:51 <BioSC> almost enough edge to be a d4
22:24:30 <Dot`> too much power
22:30:30 <Dot`> just think, 1 more waterdeep session and then we get to play those characters again skram
22:31:19 <skram> Itll be fun to be bjengelbjert again but im kinda sad to retire sil
22:31:45 <Dot`> i thought you didnt like sil
22:32:15 <skram> I dont like monks much except for that one time when they're cool as balls but sil was pretty fun as a character
22:33:57 <Dot`> what is next though, a dwarf ranger?
22:34:02 <Dot`> a bard
22:34:12 <skram> im not funny enough to be a bard
22:34:18 <skram> ranger??? thats an ELF thing
22:34:29 <skram> unless you can be a ranger with a shotgun or something
22:34:34 <Dot`> crossbow
22:34:39 <skram> no
22:35:02 <Dot`> and bards dont have to be funny
22:35:34 <Dot`> i dont see a skram wizard being a thing, maybe a druid?
22:35:51 <skram> maybe
22:35:58 <skram> wizard might be alright
22:36:11 <skram> but only if I can do the wild magic table thing for every cast i ever do
22:36:31 <Dot`> thats a sorceror
22:37:02 <Dot`> also, i tihnk rolling that table every time would tire fast, maybe a 1 shot
22:37:32 <skram> right
22:37:46 <DuB`> :O
22:37:54 <skram> maybe its bjengelbjerts brother

22:38:11 <skram> yes, him

22:38:55 <DuB`> Haughty butler in silks with a lil bit of secret edge martial-ness is a great thing
22:39:24 <Dot`> Yea, i would like to get to try reach agaon, in a bit more of a not so 1 large fight game
