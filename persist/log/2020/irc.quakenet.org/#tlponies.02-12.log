23:48:20 <DuB`> Which influence?
23:48:23 <Camail> so i take my bordom out on you

23:49:03 <DuB`> So much of it
23:49:05 <Camail> is skram good at the game yet
23:49:17 <DuB`> Got beat up by angry monkey a bit
23:49:23 <DuB`> skram hasn't played in a whiiiile
23:49:31 <Camail> because you dont force him to play
23:49:37 <Camail> be like me, really be an dick about it
23:49:42 <Runbunny> Crisium, part 5.
23:49:50 <Camail> skram: HEY PLAY GAMES WITH DUB YOU FUCK
23:50:16 <DuB`> Speaking of other people who won't hunt mons...
23:50:21 <Camail> look
23:50:32 <Camail> if i hunted mons it would just be a lie
23:50:36 <Camail> and i dont want to lie to you
23:50:58 <DuB`> I'm not sure I understand, but I appreciate the sentiment :P
23:51:01 <Camail> it took be 3 weeks to well up enough interest to try hades, it takes time
23:51:10 <Camail> i'm weird
23:51:28 <DuB`> Haha
23:51:45 <Camail> i'm hyped as fuck that you like monhun so much, tho
23:51:50 <Camail> its a very good game
23:52:02 <Runbunny> Yes.
23:52:25 <Runbunny> I got caught in playing wow with friends, so I haven't been playing as much as I wanted to either.
23:52:36 <Camail> well dub will be waiting for you
23:52:37 <Camail> watching
23:52:40 <DuB`> Only a handful of games I've had 550+ hour from for sure
23:52:40 <Camail> foaming at the mouth
23:53:00 <DuB`> And a smaller handful where that time was in <5 months...
23:53:08 <Camail> yea maybe its unhealthy
23:53:10 <Camail> but oh well
23:53:23 <Camail> at least you arent shitting out your own ass
23:53:29 <Camail> which is what happened when you tried to be healthy
23:53:33 <Camail> so this is better
23:54:07 <DuB`> I tend to just describe it as my insides bleeding but sure
23:54:27 <Camail> you were, for a brief moment, a water balloon of blood
23:55:48 <Camail> but yea, i might play it one day, maybe if it gets a story update? i can appreciate it from afar, at least
23:56:06 <Camail> i still havent finished blood and wine from witcher 3
23:56:35 <DuB`> Same, never was able to decide if I wanted to restart from the beginning or not after being away from it for like 2 years
23:56:49 <DuB`> And then it was too late because monhun!
23:56:57 <Camail> hahaha
23:57:00 <Camail> problem solved for you
23:57:31 <Camail> monhun is so good, such an immersive game for how little lore there actually is
23:57:57 <Camail> pure mechanical immersion 
23:58:00 <DuB`> Story what story
23:58:04 <Camail> lul
23:58:10 <Camail> i enjoy handler!
23:58:28 <DuB`> Definitely haven't enjoyed the core, basic gameplay mechanics of a game quite like this. Everything is satisfying
23:58:39 <Camail> the longsword counterrrrrr
23:58:44 <Camail> the switch axeeeeeee
23:58:52 <Camail> every weapons has at least one big pop
23:58:59 <DuB`> LS got ANOTHER i-frame weebslash, too
23:59:02 <Camail> the insect glaive is kinda lame thooooo
23:59:22 <Runbunny> LS is even more weeb now than before.
23:59:29 <Camail> do i get big eyes
23:59:38 <Camail> and incestuous leanings
23:59:42 <Camail> cuz thats anime
