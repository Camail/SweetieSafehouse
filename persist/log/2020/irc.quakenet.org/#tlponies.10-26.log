21:03:45 <Rawr|Fone> Look at this magnificent horse dot
21:04:11 <DuB`> I ordered a new microphone and a whole mic arm thing
21:05:03 <Dot`> dub dub
21:05:23 <skrma> dub is a streamer now
21:06:44 <Dot`> when is dub vtuber debut?
21:07:23 <reification> bio you are going to borrow food?
21:07:37 <DuB`> I would just like to not deafen my friends with click clacks whenever I'm playing lucio
21:08:00 <DuB`> Current setup is a blue snowball which kind of rolls around on my desk unsecured and is right behind my keyboard lol
21:08:14 <reification> but isn't that the point of mech keyboard?
21:08:20 <Dot`> surely a stand is cheaper dub?
21:09:13 <DuB`> I have the cheaper version of snowball which has no directionality at all, a stand wouldn't change the sound issues and would just add to my crowded desk
21:09:17 <DuB`> Arm will be nice
21:10:22 <skrma> naw its a good point
21:10:56 <skrma> been thinkin bout getting one just so i can get the mic away from my desk when im not using it
21:11:27 <skrma> anyway
21:11:28 <skrma> work work
21:11:35 <DuB`> glhf
21:11:37 <Dot`> gl skram
21:11:57 <Dot`> does everyone have a desk mic?
21:12:06 <Dot`> am i too third world for all this?
21:12:50 <DuB`> Using headset mic?
21:13:16 <Dot`> yea?
21:14:16 <DuB`> I've had the same nice headphones for 5 years now, would rather use desk mic than try to replace those
21:16:00 <Dot`> Dub, you been catching up on CR yet?
21:17:18 <DuB`> Naw, last 3 weeks have been dead busy
21:17:35 <DuB`> And vtubers take all my passive content consumption time that remains!
21:20:41 <Dot`> ah, research for your own vtuber channel, makes sense
21:22:39 <Camail> ok, new biggest sale of my poe life
21:22:44 <Camail> 90 ex is pretty nice
21:23:16 <Camail> dont feel bad for selling it that low considering i had it at 110, 100, and 95 before that
21:24:04 <reification> dot what animal will vtuber dub be?
21:24:22 <Dot`> there is aready a fox isnt there?
21:25:15 <Dot`> birb of some kind
21:28:35 <DuB`> There's two foxes and a phoenix in holo
21:28:50 <Dot`> two foxes? is that legal?
21:31:20 <DuB`> Well one is all white, the other is a fennc
21:31:22 <DuB`> Quite different!

21:40:03 <Dot`> thats for skram
21:40:31 <BioSC> we bek
21:40:47 <Camail> i played through fe3h once and enjoyed it a lot
21:41:00 <Camail> the ending fell apart, but the rest was great
21:41:09 <Camail> i want to replay it, i do
21:41:17 <Camail> but it feels weird
21:41:41 <Camail> if i choose a new house, seeing all the others treat MC like a stranger is weird
21:42:07 <DuB`> It's one of two or three reason's I'll consider a switch
21:42:23 <DuB`> Not sure how many reasons I need before I'll feel like buying
21:42:24 <BioSC> just buy their loyalty
21:42:27 <BioSC> with fame
21:42:36 <DuB`> Not sure why I apostrophe-d reasons :T
21:42:48 <BioSC> or cook many meals
21:45:24 <DuB`> I had a big katsu curry and pumpkin tempura meal yesterday
21:45:28 <DuB`> I'm STILL full
21:45:45 <BioSC> good job eating
21:46:02 <BioSC> also pumpkin tempura wat
21:46:47 <BioSC> i mean, i guess you can fry anything
21:46:54 <DuB`> Is very good
21:47:58 <DuB`> Like dis https://image.made-in-china.com/202f0j00CTWUJQrzJVgw/Frozen-Pre-Fried-Vegetable-Pumpkin-Tempura-Supplier.jpg
21:48:28 <Camail> breath of the wild is fun, overrated but very fun still
21:48:39 <Camail> it does have birds tho
21:48:43 <Camail> so you probably would love it
21:49:02 <DuB`> My reasons are fe3h and monhun rise, so far
21:49:15 <DuB`> With botw and pokemon as sort-ofs
21:49:21 <Camail> you'll be getting it for monhun, regardless
21:49:28 <Camail> 2 weeks before it comes ouy you'll break
21:49:42 <Camail> mario odyssey is VERY good
21:49:54 <Camail> i adored that game, its the next step after mario galaxy
21:51:02 <Camail> it could have more rosalina tho
21:52:08 <DuB`> How many games makes $300 worth... HMM
21:52:31 <Camail> luigi's mansion is fun and true to form
21:53:14 <Camail> if you use it for 200 hours, which is easy, its probably gonna be like 5 dollars an hour of entertainment
21:53:32 <DuB`> Troo
21:53:34 <Camail> as an adult, you can start thinking of purchases like that
21:53:43 <Camail> unless you are a child like rawr
21:54:18 <Camail> cadence of hyrule is good if you like crypt of the necrodancer
21:54:38 <DuB`> Dollars per hour of use would also make justifying a herman miller pretty easy...
21:54:50 <DuB`> Though I guess a console doesn't have cheaper comparables
21:54:56 <DuB`> Like a chair would
21:55:15 <Runbunny> Time to go work.
21:55:24 <Dot`> gl bun
21:55:27 <Camail> well, lots of people are making big purchases now, because they arent spending it on travel
21:55:30 <Camail> bye runbun
21:55:35 <Camail> i'll miss you
21:55:40 <Camail> and that tight ass
21:55:40 <BioSC> gone forever
21:56:08 <Camail> hyrule warriors is a good game to play after you play botw
21:56:25 <Camail> muso games are fun as hell, and the spin offs are even moreso
21:56:36 <Camail> the 3 kingdoms got old real fast
21:56:56 <Rawr|Fone> New luigi's mansion was really good!
21:57:33 <Camail> yea on all accounts its a great, campy, game
22:00:09 <Camail> bayonetta 2 is technially exclusive to switch cuz the wii u is dead
22:00:24 <Camail> i dont like character action personally, but you might
22:01:49 <Camail> those are all the exclusives that i'd say are worth mentioning
22:02:07 <Camail> i dont peg you as an animal crossing kind of person
