14:09:51 <Rawr|Fone> Since I only recently got hired, I don't have any paid vacation days yet
14:10:02 <Rawr|Fone> So I'm not taking any days off
14:16:38 <Dot`> thats a bit rough
14:17:01 <Rawr|Fone> I don't mind
14:17:18 <Dot`> when i started work at my place it was october and i got X% of the leave days as was left of the year
14:23:23 <Rawr|Fone> Technically I could take 5 days off with pay, but I would have to pay that back when I leave the company
14:26:28 <Dot`> ?silly
14:41:58 <Rawr|Fone> But if I stayed with the company for more than five years, I wouldn't need to pay it back

21:45:41 <skrm> i'd read it

21:50:41 <DuB`> I am die pls
21:51:49 <Dot`> dub, i advise you have internet troubles
21:55:07 <DuB`> srs
22:04:35 <Camail> unplug your ethernet, ez
22:05:45 <Camail> DuB`  i am convinced that cyberpunk is balanced around multiplayer
22:06:06 <Camail> there literally isnt enough single player content to get enough xp to hit 20
22:21:15 <Golly> i dinged 50 nailin some dude to a cross
22:21:19 <Golly> it was hilarious
22:30:56 <Camail> i skipped that job second time around
22:31:14 <Camail> thats the one i was disappointed in
22:31:19 <Camail> took him like 20 seconds to die
22:31:34 <Golly> yeah they shouldve had us stab em too
22:31:35 <Camail> when normal crucifixion takes hours, if not days
22:31:51 <Camail> the stabbing is to check if they're dead
22:31:58 <Golly> ah, right
22:32:20 <Camail> would've taken no time at all to do a time skip
22:32:41 <Camail> but this time around i shot the dude the first time you see him
22:32:55 <Camail> wakako has unique dialog for it, its kinda amusing
22:32:55 <Golly> haha
22:33:29 <Camail> the cop is immortal for some reason, but he isn't
22:33:42 <Camail> i think they just dont want to let you save the dude who hired you
22:33:58 <Camail> i found the dude's wife's grave while looking for someone else's

22:56:40 <Camail> i'm lvl 50, have been for quite awhile
22:56:48 <Camail> but my highest perk is blades at 18.4
22:57:17 <Camail> and its just not feasable to get to 20, only have  a handful of ncpd things left
22:57:34 <Camail> i did all the city center ones, which is the highest level area
22:57:42 <Golly> i got 20 engineering, but its borked and let me dismantle the hp thing endlessly
