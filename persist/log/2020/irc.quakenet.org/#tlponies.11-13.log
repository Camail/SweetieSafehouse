00:20:19 <DuB`> Always 7pm work
00:24:10 <skrm> just go home DuB` 
00:30:00 <DuB`> Am home!
00:30:16 <DuB`> That's the problem with "home office", home becomes office and you're always in it
00:31:12 <skrm> Just say you have a hot date at the roller disco and log out of teams
00:31:54 <DuB`> Why am I going on dates and going to roller discos in the midst of a pandemic!
00:34:40 <skrm> I read an article in a national newspaper about a guy who had a one night stand and got the coronas
00:34:48 <skrm> he said it was worth it
00:35:21 <skrm> so maybe roller discoing with some fly honeys is worth it despite the plague

07:59:22 <Rawr|Fone> I did during my internship
08:00:31 <Rawr|Fone> This is for managing internal access levels for other applications
08:01:56 <skram> sounds difficult
08:09:01 <Rawr|Fone> It's pretty much so people can easily say, hey I need to access these pages and I can't do that with my current role
08:09:20 <Rawr|Fone> And then that persons boss can say ok or no
08:09:35 <Rawr|Fone> If they are approved they can access the page

14:01:53 <Dot|Phone> Got all the way home. 40 minutes walk uphill to find I had left my keys at the office
14:04:15 <Cane> So, I'm all back into roguelikes right now.
14:04:36 <Cane> I downloaded Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead because I'd never played it before. Here's hoping it's awesome.
14:07:22 <Dot|Phone> It looks really cool.i think I last looked at it about a year ago. There is a lot to it
14:07:31 <Cane> Yeah, it's a big game.
14:07:51 <Dot|Phone> The dorf Fort of stalkers 
14:08:17 <Cane> Hah, that's a pretty good description.

14:32:08 <Cane> The game has a dedicated suicide button. It's that kind of atmosphere.
14:32:23 <Dot`> haha
14:32:59 <Dot`> now is it becuase you expect to want to just end it or its so buggy its the final solution to fix it

17:12:35 <Runbunny> Well, it was all right, but then I spent like 3 hours trying to find stuff.
17:13:22 <Runbunny> But I got a bunch of ideas for optimizations.
17:13:32 <Runbunny> So hopefully that will be rolled out next week.
