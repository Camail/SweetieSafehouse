20:12:54 <BioPhone> No dot
20:13:05 <BioPhone> Because I've been doing this thing for a while
20:13:37 <BioPhone> Where I get home, make dinner, eat, shower, then sit and stare at my monitor until it's time for bed
20:13:42 <BioPhone> I'm the werst
20:14:14 <BioPhone> I'll probably play some this weekend tho
20:17:21 <carcinisation> i went to request an interlibrary loan at my local library today
20:17:40 -!- Micen_ [~Micen@h6.74.23.98.dynamic.ip.windstream.net] has joined #tlponies
20:17:49 <carcinisation> and was informed the price had changed from Â£3.50 to Â£20... D:
20:18:11 <carcinisation> i did not proceed with the request
20:18:24 <Camail> how the hell?
20:18:26 <Rawr|Fone> ðŸ¤¨ðŸ¤¨
20:18:56 <Camail> tbf the only time i ever did that was in college and it was free
20:19:11 <Camail> but still that's a lot, way more than shipping costs....
20:20:29 <carcinisation> the librarian wasn't exactly happy about it but it's not in her control
20:20:59 <carcinisation> apparently it cost them about Â£10 (this is out of county but not international)
20:21:39 <carcinisation> and so the council decided to jack the price up
20:33:25 <Dot|Phone> Hmm
20:38:45 <Camail> sounds like some dumb political stunt ruined it at some point

21:25:43 <carcinisation> plus there is currently a big ongoing consultation about our whole library system happening right now
