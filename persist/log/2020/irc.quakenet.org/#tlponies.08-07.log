23:03:28 <BioPhone> I did it lads
23:03:33 <BioPhone> I took a nap
23:03:40 <BioPhone> And didn't do a sleep
23:03:49 <skram> good job pal
23:04:00 <skram> are you rested now
23:08:23 <BioPhone> No üòÅ
23:14:22 <Dot|Phone> Skram all I need from you is to not see through walls
23:17:53 <reification> g'night all
23:18:13 <Dot|Phone> Gnight Reif
23:21:32 <skram> that i cannot promise
23:26:48 <BioSC> that seems like a good super power tbh
23:36:21 <Dot|Phone> As is the ability to read the monster manual mid fight or read the module
23:37:04 <skram> i did consider getting the module just so we can open this stupid fuckin' door
23:37:29 <Dot|Phone> You really don't like puzzles
23:38:01 <skram> i do like puzzles
23:38:10 <skram> but only the ones i that i can solve in 5 minutes or less
23:39:09 <Dot|Phone> Well you spent 10 seconds smashing 3 gems, 4 minutes 50 seconds to go
23:45:34 <Dot|Phone> I need to start incorporating adventure game logic on my games. You need that broken toothbrush from earlier so you can use the bristles to scare a wombat by making it think there is a spider on it
23:45:47 <Dot|Phone> The wombat then runs into the Alley
23:46:06 <Dot|Phone> Dislodging a drain pipe that reveals a nick in the wall
23:46:28 <Dot|Phone> The you can use a button on the widen 
23:46:48 <Dot|Phone> Opening a secret door 
23:48:49 <BioSC> G A M E  D E S I G N
23:51:13 <skram> this is like silent hill level puzzlery
23:53:31 <Dot|Phone> After this module is done skram I'll go through the modules suggested way to get through this door
23:54:53 <skram> cool
23:55:33 <BioSC> its probably find the big key hidden under the rug dummy
23:56:03 <skram> im 69% certain there are no rubs in this room
23:57:28 <Dot|Phone> Is a carved sun in the floor not a dwarven rug? 
23:58:06 <skram> no??
23:59:17 <DuB`> Only the finest alpaca wool for Sil
