13:50:43 <skrm> oh shit dude
13:50:48 <skrm> you can make your own memes??
13:50:59 <Bio> YEH
13:51:14 <Bio> tho would have been funnier with Bottom Text on the top
13:51:20 <skrm> amazing
13:51:24 <Bio> next time
13:51:45 <Bio> the more I look at this image the more i giggle
13:52:14 <Bio> there goes any productivity today
13:52:22 <skrm> :D
13:52:35 <skrm> bruh theres a new gril at my work and shes mad cute
13:54:59 <skrm> she's like 150 tall and her glasses are most of her head
13:57:17 <Bio> 150, thats like almost all the pokemon
13:57:34 <Bio> ask her if she wants to see your legos
13:57:46 <Dot`> cant fail
13:58:29 <Bio> be sure to wear your best horseshoes and get your coat brushed
13:59:40 <reification> good plan bio, after all why would you want a girl that can't appreciate your legos?
14:00:51 <skrm> good plan lads
14:01:02 <skrm> she said she was real good at pokemon arena on n64
14:01:48 <Bio> instant marry
14:03:01 <skrm> its impossible unfortunately
14:03:05 <skrm> she's swedish
14:04:03 <Dot`> how is she even in norway?
14:04:22 <skrm> cars probably
14:04:32 <reification> but girls tend to be silly anyway, so is that really an impediment?
14:05:38 <reification> as we have seen recently, easy transport between countries round the globe is a double edged sword :p
14:06:17 <skrm> ah well borders are mostly closed but its ok if its for work
14:08:24 <Dot`> skrm, what are her thoughts on board games? we need mroe players
14:08:54 <skrm> i should ask
14:09:03 <skrm> maybe this time, TLP will win a coop board game
14:09:35 <Dot`> doubtful
14:10:03 <Dot`> though when are you free to play board games this wekeend skram?
14:10:06 <Dot`> i want to try win again
14:10:38 <skrm> late sunday evening maybe
14:11:01 <Dot`> D:
14:13:36 <Rawr|Fone> Jonas
14:13:50 <skrm> Henrique
14:14:25 <Rawr|Fone> How are you doing today dear
14:15:19 <skrm> pretty decent i suppose
14:15:35 <skrm> i fixed A Thing and then praticed my danish
14:15:43 <skrm> hows your face
14:20:09 <reification> dotties maybe i can join you this weekend if you are short on people? saturday evening is no good though sadly
14:20:36 <Dot`> oh yea, you have TTS now dont you!
14:20:47 <reification> yes
14:20:53 <Dot`> all horses always welcome 
14:21:06 <Dot`> im just so use to pinging the same ppl
14:21:21 <reification> np
14:22:08 <DuB`> I may be terraria-busy this weekend :P
14:22:12 <reification> oh i had two things for you skram. first this twitter account i think you will appreciate: https://twitter.com/goldenerajapan
14:22:42 <Dot`> dub you can terraria in your own time
14:23:36 <reification> second this faux light novel isekai i may have recommended for you before: http://yudkowsky.net/other/fiction/girl-intercorrupted/
14:24:00 <reification> it has sufficient degeneracy you won't be able to believe it didn't come from japan
14:24:35 <reification> too bad dub looks like dot has claimed you :p
14:26:03 <reification> that OC really hits the mark bio; your time studying the memes has been well spent.
14:27:46 <DuB`> Yeah I'm not sure what that means dot LOL
14:28:33 <Rawr|Fone> I am working skrm
14:28:35 <skrm> My family name is Yugano. My given name is Yuuki. I have no redeeming qualities.
14:28:36 <Dot`> its means you can terraira anytime, while there are only certain times we can all game together
14:28:39 <Rawr|Fone> Lots of stuff to do
14:28:46 <skrm> what a great way to introduce the main character reifen :p
14:28:52 <skrm> twitter account is straight fire tho
14:29:07 <skrm> whens your weekend henriken
14:29:46 <DuB`> Turns out getting 5 people together in a terraria server is similarly time-dependent and involves more than just my own time, unfortunately :P
14:30:04 <Rawr|Fone> When I want pretty much jonas
14:30:34 <Dot`> Ah, last you told me dub you had planned to play it slowly on your own
14:30:57 <Rawr|Fone> I work from home and my company doesn't really care what hours I work, as long as I show up to meetings and get my work done
14:32:08 <skrm> https://twitter.com/goldenerajapan/status/1257359612636004362/photo/1 look at this supra gt

14:46:25 <skrm> its a right proper vroomer
14:46:30 <skrm> has good noises
14:46:59 <Dot`> im not a fan of car noises, less so of noisy ones
14:47:11 <skrm> most of them lying in pieces in some mountain road in japan, probably
14:47:15 <skrm> youths, amirite
