14:02:30 <Rawr|Fone> You are back!
14:09:56 <Dot`> Rawr!
14:10:01 <Dot`> i had to go sort out my apartment
14:10:12 <Rawr|Fone> Hmm
14:10:37 <Dot`> its getting inspected and i havnt really been there much the past few months
14:11:17 <Dot`> hows you rawr
14:14:31 <Rawr|Fone> Good good, playing more table tennis today
14:14:39 <Dot`> nice!
14:14:46 <Dot`> any tournies planned?
14:24:53 <Rawr|Fone> There are some, but there's lots of restrictions
14:25:03 <Rawr|Fone> Probably going to wait
14:25:31 <Rawr|Fone> The league event will be like usual though, since it only gathers like 20 people
14:25:42 <Rawr|Fone> Starts next weekend
14:27:51 <Dot`> ping pong tournies should be safer than most sports, you have a table to keep distance
14:29:16 <Rawr|Fone> True

17:50:02 <Dot`> runbun please
17:50:05 <Dot`> awnser the question
17:50:28 <DuB`> Perhaps runbun's state depends on your wellness, dot
17:52:25 <reification> but what if dot's state also depends on runbun?
17:52:34 <Runbunny> Surely my day is always better if the great survivor of the bakewell power outage of 2020 is feeling great.
17:54:27 <Dot`> Im doing pretty well, but sunday evening already
17:56:33 <Runbunny> Transcend the meaning of week days.
