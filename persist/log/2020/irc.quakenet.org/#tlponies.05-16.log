17:34:06 <Rawr|Fone> No chat
17:34:27 <Dot`> if your chatting your not playing terraria
17:47:51 <reification> so i have started watching a very wholesome new animated tv series
17:48:00 <reification> i say new but the show actually finished a while back
17:48:21 <reification> it's very colourful and has princesses in it, which is fair enough as the target audience is young girls
17:48:54 <reification> sure it's obviously been made with an eye to selling toys but the love that's clearly been put into it shines through in all the details
17:49:15 <reification> each show has a message built into it and the main character loves books
17:49:41 <reification> i know most people would not be at all interested in that kind of thing but i thought maybe you might be?
17:50:04 <reification> anyway the show is called...
