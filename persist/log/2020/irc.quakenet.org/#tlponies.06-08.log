16:26:53 <Zounds> hi guys
16:27:03 <Zounds> werks done gonna order a pizza
16:27:35 <Runbunny> Nice. Get a banana curry pizza.
16:27:47 <skram> what
16:29:29 <Runbunny> I heard about it from a swede Jonas.
16:29:34 <Runbunny> It's apparently "good"
16:29:47 <skram> Im pretty sure this person was lying to you, Anders
16:30:15 <Runbunny> He seemed genuine.
16:30:26 <Runbunny> He is, however, swedish.
16:31:14 <skram> There's a limit even to swedens degeneracy, runbun
16:36:00 <Zounds> First time I visited my friend in sweden we had that
16:36:06 <Zounds> So it is a thing
16:36:35 <skram> :(
16:36:45 <Zounds> It was ok
16:37:46 <reification> every day we stray further...
16:38:57 <Dot`> just need to add some pinapple to that
16:39:26 <Runbunny> O:
16:39:32 <Runbunny> Dot is a master chef?
16:40:27 <Zounds> I've nothing against pineapple on pizza except for the opportunity cost
16:41:02 <Zounds> So if I'm ordering my own its not going on but if its around I'll eat it sure
16:43:12 <Zounds> going for pepperoni and jalape√±o tonight should be nice
16:43:14 <Zounds> its on the way
16:43:32 <Zounds> I skipped lunch so im a hungry boy
16:44:50 <skram> well now im hungry too
16:45:21 <Dot`> its still so far from friday
16:45:25 <Dot`> no pizza for DAYS
16:48:48 <Runbunny> True.
16:48:59 <Runbunny> We can starve together Dot.
16:50:09 <Zounds> don't starve together‚Ñ¢
16:59:21 <skram> maybe ill just make my own pizza
