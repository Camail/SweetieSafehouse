19:53:27 <Camail> oh dot, you're getting close to being caught up
19:53:34 <Camail> you'll get there by the next episode, for sure
20:42:18 <Golly> what was the new ad solution cam?
20:42:34 <Camail> eh, nothing now
20:42:44 <Camail> all the small fixes are dead again
20:43:04 <Camail> they were basically embedding the stream into twitches own website
20:43:24 <Camail> and using certain settings that would cause ads to not happen
20:43:30 <Camail> but thats all fixed
20:48:13 <Golly> i wonder just how many resources they are using to keep up
20:48:32 <Golly> i feel like historically the big companies have always lost these sorts of battles
20:49:03 <Golly> like all the game drm etc

21:47:31 <Cane> Recently the DRM war is leaning towards companies winning.
21:47:51 <Cane> But mostly because piracy is illegal and a lot of the groups have had major crackdowns, so there's fewer people doing it now.
21:47:53 <Golly> time to support gog then I guess
21:48:09 <Camail> what games haven't been cracked?
21:48:10 <Cane> Anti-ad stuff is legal and dedicated and worldwide.
21:48:30 <Cane> Denuvo games right now is seeing 1-6 month delays between release and being cracked.
21:48:54 <Camail> i dont see that as a victory for companies
21:49:46 <Camail> anyone who wants to play for free will get a more patched, and completely unlocked DLC version
21:49:54 <Cane> Why not? That's what they want--a delay on their games being cracked so people who want them early will pick them up before they're broken.
21:50:09 <Camail> but pirates get exactly what they want, the game
21:50:47 <Cane> And companies get their own win: The games remain uncracked for at least a week, possibly even a month or more, which they think ensure more week-1 sales.
21:50:49 <Camail> both sides can win if they want different things
21:51:21 <Cane> Everything gets cracked with time, but Denuvo & DRM companies are open about trying to delay, not prevent.
21:51:32 <Cane> Used to be shit got cracked within a day or three.
21:52:01 <Camail> my point is that its not a  dichotomy thats leaning towards companies winning
21:52:03 <Cane> But I'm with you Golly. I buy on GOG first, if it's available there.
21:52:07 <Camail> i dont believe in the zero sum game here
21:52:39 <Camail> piracy has had a resurgence int he last few ytears, it was rough for awhile with a lot of scene groups going down
21:52:54 <Camail> but there has been multiple names popping back up and cracking games
21:53:16 <Camail> i'm just arguing for the silver lining
21:54:27 <Golly> id be curious about the worth of those early sales vs the cost of the drm
21:54:37 <Golly> and even worse, consumer good will
21:54:48 <Golly> which is hard to quantify i fuess
21:54:51 <Golly> guess
