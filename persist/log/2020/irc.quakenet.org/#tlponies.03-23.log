10:31:05 <reification> you can do it bun
10:31:15 <Dot`> good luck bun, i believe in you
10:31:24 <reification> those vtubers aren't going to watch themselves
10:32:02 <Dot`> well they probably are
10:32:18 <Dot`> but not much money to be made form 1 view
10:32:25 <reification> also get your gaming in before that gets shut down "to save internet capacity"
10:32:51 <Dot`> becuase gaming uses so much internet compared to all the ppl watchign netflex >.>
10:33:34 <reification> you and i understand that but think how many ppl still don't understand the data difference between text, images and video... :/
10:34:10 <Dot`> ill pre download and hoard my gaming internet then!
10:34:22 <reification> and gaming will be seen as more frivolous mark my words
