13:49:52 <reification> you can use a tool like this to see if the recruitment tags you get can be used to force a high rarity operator
13:49:58 <Runbunny> Reif the ticket missions are kinda a drag though
13:50:12 <reification> in the event bun?
13:50:15 <Runbunny> Yes.
13:50:35 <Runbunny> I keep having like 300 tickets.
