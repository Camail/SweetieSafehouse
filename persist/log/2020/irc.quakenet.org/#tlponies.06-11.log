22:17:32 <Camail> oi
22:17:56 <skram> hoi
22:18:14 <reification> hoi hoi
22:31:15 <Camail> Runbunny  the new impale gloves are gonna make melee map clear appreciably better, not gonna have to rely on bleed-splosions
22:31:32 <Dot|Phone> Cam
22:31:35 <Camail> so you could even go max block glad and skip bleed entirely
22:31:36 <Camail> dot.
22:31:51 <Runbunny> A new unique?
22:32:02 <Runbunny> I only saw the reworked uniques.

22:32:21 <Camail> it also adds impale chance which is actually really important
22:32:41 <Runbunny> Hmm.
22:32:43 <Camail> because its super easy to hit 90% cahnce, but having to get that last 10% was never really fun, usually ended up at like 115%
22:33:53 <Camail> flat phys is also hella nice
22:34:34 <Runbunny> I don't think I ever did impale.
22:34:54 <Camail> impale is pretty much the only way to scale phys damage
22:34:58 <Camail> into the end game
22:35:54 <Camail> those gloves with vuln on hit would be a heavy contender for bis
22:36:44 <Camail> it looks to be a boss unique, which are t4 or t5 seeds
22:36:52 <Camail> we dont know exactly which
22:44:07 <Runbunny> Well there is no rush.
22:44:19 <Runbunny> speaking of rushing.
22:44:28 <Runbunny> I'll rush myself to bed, goodnight.
22:44:34 <Camail> goddnight
22:44:38 <Camail> cya tomorrow
22:44:40 <Camail> unless
22:44:42 <Camail> the world ends
22:45:55 <Runbunny> Well, if the world ends then we will truly see eachother.
22:46:02 <Runbunny> Fare thee well brother.

23:01:48 <DuB`> Mebbe I try PoE again
23:01:52 <DuB`> 4th time's the charm
23:03:00 <Camail> its a good time to start, league is very very simple
23:03:36 <Camail> enki's arc witch is a good build to follow if you want it to tell you everything you need to do
23:04:01 <Camail> both arc and unleash are better than when i first played it so you could literally only play that till the end
23:06:28 <Camail> i dont think i will be quite as rich this league, tho
23:07:11 <DuB`> o no
23:08:16 <Camail> seeing as you're you, you'll probably never leave the top half of the passive skill tree
23:08:26 <Camail> that's where all the spell stuff is
23:34:55 <DuB`> Arcs oke doke
23:49:04 <Camail> you can plug and play a few spells into that same set up
