09:05:07 <Dot`> Runbun
09:11:19 <Runbunny> Dot.
09:11:30 <Runbunny> You think Hob will do it?
09:11:38 <Runbunny> 7 weeks, 7 games.
09:11:40 <Dot`> 1 no hit a week?
09:11:49 <Dot`> seems doable 
09:11:56 <Dot`> if he stops stalling and blaming chat
09:19:26 <Runbunny> But his mind is like an asparagus.
10:57:33 <Cane> It's hailing so hard I hear hail landing inside the chimney.
10:57:44 <Cane> Norway's been interesting lately.
10:58:37 <Golly> maybe in your part, my part has been rain as usual
11:00:56 <Cane> The lawn outside looks like it's full of decorative white gravel.
11:01:09 <Cane> Usually hail doesn't last. This has been going for ~15 minutes.
11:10:27 <Runbunny> Godspeed Cane.

15:00:14 <Cane> What item, Golly?
15:00:40 <Golly> https://grimdawn.gamepedia.com/Marauder%27s_Talisman_(relic)
15:02:47 <Dot`> good idea bun
15:02:51 <Dot`> hey reif
15:02:57 <reification> hey dotties
15:03:46 <reification> runbun what is happen in denmark?! https://mobile.twitter.com/thijskuiken/status/1324816168465608704
15:06:44 <Runbunny> Yeah, shit is hitting the fan.
15:07:05 <Rawr|Fone> Seems like we have to get rid of denmark
15:07:15 <Dot`> Runbun, you should stay inside more
15:09:31 <Runbunny> I am :P
15:14:12 <Cane> Aha, good luck Golly.
15:14:37 <Golly> kinda annoyed you need a crafted item to make another crafted item
15:15:10 <Golly> AND get it to drop off of low % chance

15:34:36 <Dot`> Dub Dub
15:35:59 <DuB`> Dot Dot
15:57:24 <Dot`> Hows you
16:01:56 <DuB`> No complaints!
16:02:28 <DuB`> Had to work until nearly 8pm on a friday, but now I have a big sausage egg 'n cheese bagel and blueberry muffin
16:03:16 <DuB`> And my favorite thing of the week happened https://www.reddit.com/r/Hololive/comments/jpj02l/out_of_context/
16:05:04 <Dot`> hmm, bagel sounds good
16:20:32 <Runbunny> Excellent clip Dub.
16:40:57 <DuB`> Been hearing lots of cheering outside
16:41:03 <DuB`> I think we fired cheeto man
16:41:13 <Golly> out of a cannon?
16:41:19 <DuB`> Not yet
16:45:39 <Dot`> GG
17:10:39 <Runbunny> So Biden won?
17:12:11 <Cane> Yup.
17:12:57 <Runbunny> Neat.
17:22:19 <Rawr|Fone> Technically not, but probably
17:23:49 <reification> there is about zero chance the count changes against biden, legal drama is more likely
17:24:06 <Rawr|Fone> Yes
17:26:16 <Golly> i just want footage of the secret service dragging his ass out
17:27:17 <Golly> and maybe Sanders with a steel chair from behind

23:15:05 <Dot`> everytime i mention a run to you he gets hit
23:15:07 <Dot`> so it sone of us
23:15:14 <Dot`> its one*
23:15:18 <Runbunny> Hmm.
23:15:58 <Runbunny> That is called clustering illusion no?
23:18:50 <Dot`> i guess it would be, thats far easier to say than "correlation does not imply causation"
23:43:50 <DuB`> Burger, fries, and milkshake get
23:44:00 <DuB`> Worth splurging america-like today
23:44:03 <DuB`> Phew
23:47:11 <Dot`> borger!
23:56:13 <Runbunny> Dot`, I think Hob is feeling the pressure.
23:57:07 <DuB`> What was his bet again?
