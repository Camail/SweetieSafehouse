21:00:23 <reification> no you are right i got mixed up with https://twitter.com/RoaNoises
21:00:29 <Runbunny> Hmm, I remember that specific twitter.
21:01:04 <Runbunny> Anyhoo, Mio has been trying getting over it with Bennet Foddy. So far she hasn't passed the devils chimney.
21:01:09 <Runbunny> It has been 6 hours.
21:03:27 <reification> i am also 6 hours in, have just made it to the furniture bit... 
21:04:23 <reification> i want a twitter that is just roa squeaks
21:05:23 <reification> oh she has duck assistance
21:05:42 <Runbunny> Yeah, Duck joined in a few hours ago.
21:06:32 <reification> nice wakaba mark

21:07:59 <reification> the yellow and green V that is used for new drivers in japan

21:12:16 <reification> i can't watch stuff past where i am bun, that would be cheating :/ 
21:13:05 <reification> it's unfortunate mio doesn't seem to realise she doesn't need to be on the rock to climb the chimney
21:13:06 <Runbunny> towa mom did a collab with Marine. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuQ-1E4rg70
21:13:43 <reification> you are a vtuber expert
21:14:02 <Runbunny> I have people. 
21:15:29 <Runbunny> and I am shamelessly exploiting their hard work, so I can link stuff to other people :D
21:16:20 <reification> also she uses exactly the wrong method to get on the rock...
21:17:08 <Runbunny> Her control hasn't improved a lot the past 6 hours sadly.
21:19:25 <reification> in my experience it's an unfortunate place to be stuck because it doesn't give good general practise
