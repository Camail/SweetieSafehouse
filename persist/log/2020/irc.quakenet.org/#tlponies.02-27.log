22:07:02 <skram> thats like 2 months
22:07:45 <skram> are there very many infected in japan rial
22:07:58 <Crisium> they have the most cases outside of china right
22:08:06 <Rawr|Fone> DoT
22:08:24 <reify> just got a call from screwfix this afernoon, they ran out of masks at national warehouse so can‚Äôt do my order :/
22:09:51 <skram> good times to be a face mask factory i guess

22:10:58 <skram> china wanted to buy all the masks in norwegian pharmacys when it broke out
22:11:04 <reify> the world is going to learn the costs of just in time delivery after having reaped the benefits for some time
22:11:11 <skram> now that its arrived up here its all sold out
22:11:51 <Rial> I dunoo =w= I don't have tv at home anymore
22:12:16 <Rial> reif is right
22:13:07 <Rial> regarding masks, there's this =w= https://www.lifesavvy.com/18465/do-surgical-masks-really-protect-against-the-flu/
22:14:01 <Rial> I'm just really really sad and angry that people are not going to local chinese restaurants over this.
22:15:18 <reify> yes that is the case for surgical masks, but i mean actual respirator masks which do protect the wearer (when used correctly)
22:15:44 <reify> though it will mean shaving my beard :(
22:16:05 <skram> what like ffp3 masks?
22:16:26 <DuB`> Ye I think having some gloves would help most, especially riding the subway etc for me
22:16:52 <Rial> gloves are lit. masks with filters are effective, yea
22:17:24 <reify> p2 should be enough skram
22:19:55 <reification> runbun i tried to .tell you this paper earlier but sweatie was unresponsive https://www.scribd.com/document/448477684/Coronavirus-Did-Not-Originate-in-Huanan-Market-Chinaxiv
22:20:40 <Rial> ooo is this the rumor of a lab leak that I read a few days ago?
22:21:34 <reification> there has been a fair amount of circumstantial evidence for some time
22:21:45 <Rial> ooo this is the actual study paper! nice find, reif
22:22:59 <reification> the thing was this paper getting referenced by the global times (which is effectively the chinese government)
22:23:45 <Rial> oh dear
