12:34:46 <Golly> uh oh, I may have misjudged the amount of cookie dough i was supposed to use
12:34:54 <Golly> it looks more like cookie pizza in there
12:35:10 <skram> that sounds like the opposite of a problem golly
12:35:23 <Golly> well yes but also no
12:35:50 <Golly> i need to be able to package them in a non silly way
12:36:43 <skram> hmmmm
12:36:45 <skram> pizzabox?
12:39:22 <Golly> I think that would qualify as silly
12:40:32 <Dot`> if you recieved a pizza sized box and it was one massive cookie i think anyone would be very happy

21:00:14 <Runbunny> Hai Dub.
21:00:36 <Dot`_> dub dub
21:03:15 <DuB`> Hallu
21:09:13 <DuB`> Christmas break time!
21:13:44 <reification> pls do not break christmas any further :p
21:29:01 <DuB`> hah
21:29:14 <DuB`> I did a small amount of cleaning with a little bleach-based cleaner
21:29:25 <DuB`> My hands will now smell like bleach for the next month
21:29:34 <Runbunny> Oh no :(
21:36:43 <Camail> i'll probably get risk of rain 2 for christmas
21:36:48 <Camail> seems like a good stacking game
21:37:04 <Runbunny> I wanna stack.
21:37:08 <DuB`> It is nice
21:37:47 <Camail> well that was easy enough
21:38:05 <Camail> this weekend, then
21:38:15 <DuB`> O ya, winter sale
21:38:19 <Camail> eyup
21:38:31 <DuB`> Just Horizon Zero Dawn for my wishlist
21:38:37 <DuB`> On sale, that is
21:38:50 <DuB`> MHW and IB back on sale but nobody left to buy it for :P
21:39:02 <Camail> hzd is a fun game
21:39:41 <Runbunny> I was kinda interested in that one.
21:39:43 <Camail> i kinda know the ending and the dlc is a huge grind fest so i didnt end up finsihing it
21:39:54 <Camail> but going in blind hzd is good
21:40:20 <Camail> its classic AAA open world, but the gameplay is actually good so the cooki-cutter open world isn't bad
21:40:26 <Runbunny> But it was exclusive when it came out and it just vanished from streams seemingly in like a day or 2.
21:41:41 <Camail> it has a super fun aesthetic, legitimately interesting world building, ashley burch is good
21:41:51 <Camail> i pirated it so i cant comment on cost
21:41:56 <Camail> but its a good game
21:43:16 <Runbunny> Yah, I think it's just one of those that I'll get eventually.
21:44:24 <Camail> outer wilds is my game of the year by far, if anyone is interested in the best exploration game ever created
21:44:53 <Runbunny> Ah yeah, cool game, I'll have to play that eventually as well.
21:46:31 <Camail> vermintide 2 is 8 USD
21:46:46 <Camail> i would like to stack that as well
21:46:58 <Camail> considering its eating up 110 GB of my drive
21:47:46 <Dot`_> i still have Vermintide 2 installed
21:48:37 <Camail> wow hollow knight was 2017
21:49:27 <Runbunny> Vermintide 2 is big?
21:49:31 <Runbunny> I'll get in on that as well.
21:49:44 <Camail> it is physically large, yes
21:52:33 <Camail> my new mic gets here on the 29th but the old one still exists, it just sucks
21:53:49 <Camail> there's a pony dating sim called "Friendship with Benefits", its not on sale its just under 10$ so it hits the filter
21:54:18 <Camail> which feels like its riding on DMCA like a tight rope
21:54:29 <Camail> moving on
21:56:55 <Camail> Furi is good if you like games like Furi
21:57:08 <Camail> its a top down boss rush: the game
21:57:28 <Camail> very good at what it does, and it does 1 thing
22:00:58 <Golly> Cease with Desist
22:06:13 <Golly> gonna play ziggurat 2
22:06:27 <Golly> still early access tho so
22:06:50 <Golly> may wanna wait
22:06:54 <Golly> loved the first one

23:19:55 <DuB`> Need to head midtown tomorow mornin and actually get some things for myself...
23:20:19 <Runbunny> Get something good!
23:20:30 <DuB`> Feel like there might be shopping crowds on the 24th though, which is a bit yucky
23:20:40 <DuB`> Crowds is yab
23:27:30 <skrm> ya be
23:31:26 <Camail> dub why not use food delivery or curb side pick up
23:31:59 <Camail> i havent needed to go to a store like all year
23:32:53 <DuB`> I do, lots. My christmas present was a gift card for clothes though, so I need to actually go use it
23:32:59 <DuB`> Never had much luck clothes shopping online
23:38:33 <Camail> hmmm, make clothes out of milk cartons 
23:41:30 <DuB`> So style

23:51:48 <Camail> this was mostly for the save fix
23:52:06 <Camail> which was a pretty critical bug for their only player base
23:52:16 <DuB`> ye
23:52:40 <Camail> my save file with nearly 100% completion is only 5.5mb
23:52:50 <Camail> i cant imagine how much people were crafting to hit 8
23:53:49 <Camail> the one thing i dont really like about cyberpunk's overall gameplay design is how level scaling works
23:54:07 <Camail> if your build is amazing but the scaling is very high, you just die
23:54:27 <Camail> the damage mitigation they apply based on overall level is just so much
23:54:46 <BioPhone> Gevenin
23:55:00 <Camail> and then the damage bonus you get from very low scaling is just insane
23:55:39 <Camail> its once again something that was designed for online, persistent gameplay
23:56:02 <Camail> which screams "project lead doesnt know which game they're making"
23:58:40 <Camail> the character progression is god tier tho
23:59:03 <Camail> you really feel like you're getting stronger with each perk, and buying cyberwear feels really good
23:59:35 <Camail> its just that the game scales independently from most of your character progression
