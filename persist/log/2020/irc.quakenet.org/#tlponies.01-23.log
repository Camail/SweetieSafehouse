03:43:53 <Micen> I think pork is my fav meat. 
03:43:58 <Micen> but lamb is good. 
03:44:43 <Crisium> #1 lamb

04:57:15 <Micen> whale is illegal to own or import unless you have a very specific hunting license, then you have to go whaling to get meat and you are only allowed to kill very very specific whales at certain times. 
04:57:56 <DuB`> Or
04:58:04 <DuB`> Go get some whale sashimi in japan!
04:59:30 <Micen> that would be way cheaper 
04:59:47 <Micen> a ticket is like what 2,00USD?
05:00:14 <Micen> about half that
05:01:21 <Micen> plus passport. thats doable, more than spending money to buy a whaling boat, learn to use said boat and equipment, and fly across the country to do said whaling

20:59:20 <Crisium> how you folks doin
21:01:31 <skrma> we're going to work now
21:01:32 <skrma> :((((((
21:02:53 <Crisium> :(
21:03:29 <DuB`> But skrma
21:03:33 <DuB`> There are mons
21:03:37 <DuB`> Out alone in the cold
21:04:39 <DuB`> They can be warmed by imparting kinetic energy to their bodies by way of large implements of metal and bone
21:05:53 <Runbunny> And at the moment of impact some of the kinectic energy is converted to thermal energy?
21:06:03 <DuB`> Of course
21:10:13 <DuB`> Dunno if I'll feel up to team karaoke and dinner tonight...
21:15:39 <BioPhone> Leave the mons alon
21:15:47 <BioPhone> They did nothing!
21:15:59 <reification> runbun if your knives are 100% efficient that has some major implications 
21:16:05 <BioPhone> Instead make plates
21:26:01 <Runbunny> Doesn't have to be knives, anything you slam into anything will create some heat with sufficient force.
21:29:47 <Dot`> anything good in steam sale?
