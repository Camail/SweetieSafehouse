01:23:53 <Crisium|2> oof
01:24:04 <skrm> uh oh
01:24:18 <Micen|Droid> Yikes. Do it dub and be safe
01:26:06 <DuB`> Anyone who visited floors 16-19 in the last week, basically. I work on 15 but visit 16-17 pretty regularly for meetings.

01:38:16 <DuB`> Indefinite sick leave, and can very easily work from home
01:38:25 <DuB`> ... certainly glad I did a lot of food shopping recently
01:47:36 <Camail> order a family sized pizza
01:47:58 <Camail> then nibble on it for the entire 2 weeks
01:48:06 <Camail> that will probably be enough
01:48:27 <DuB`> mhmm
01:49:21 <DuB`> Well if I get bored of storage-type food, I guess ubereats etc wouldn't be breaking self-quarantine if I don't go touching the lobby doorknobs 'n stuff
01:53:20 <skrm> how many rolls of tp do you have though
01:53:32 <DuB`> Four :P
01:54:05 <skrm> you're not gonna make it pal
01:54:16 <DuB`> Haha
01:54:32 <DuB`> Theyll last me like lotsa weeks
01:54:49 <skrm> you need like 9 a day
01:55:00 <DuB`> And I only need to self-quarantine until 14 days after last possible exposure date which apparently was the 6th, so I'm just stuck until next friday
01:55:42 <skrm> thats not so bad
01:56:27 <skrm> gives you time to catch up on maplestory
01:58:48 <Camail> do you have cleaning products? gonna have to wipe down alllll ur stuff
01:59:02 <Camail> and clean skram while you're at it
01:59:12 <Camail> he has been far too filthy for far too long
01:59:54 <skrm> ive been cleaning my hands with acohol gel stuff so much im probably drunk
02:00:13 <DuB`> Yeh wipes 'n soaps 'n sprays 
02:00:55 <Camail> yea but has anyone scrubbed down your soul yet, skram?
02:01:06 <Camail> thats where the garbage has settled

20:31:18 <Golly> dunno if its legit
20:31:39 <reimeuk> yep, shut things down till the weather heats up and fast track the research seems the sensible plan to me
20:34:21 <reimeuk> that looks promising even if you can't count your chickens till they hatch or your vaccine till it passes trials

21:06:38 <Dot`> sounds like a reasnable thing to do currently
21:08:43 <carcinisation> i think it was planned long ago and he was being stubborn cause he's usually pretty smart

21:47:14 <Runbunny> Dot`, all right.
21:48:32 <Runbunny> I basically just played a lot of path of exile.
21:49:34 <skrm> anders you nerd
21:49:39 <skrm> what build you doing this time
21:51:49 <Camail> Runbunny  poe reddit is full of people bitching about delirium, it's hilarious
21:51:54 <Runbunny> Yeah
21:51:59 <Camail> the league is great
21:52:04 <Camail> the density is so damn good
21:52:04 <Runbunny> I am doing the cobra kai.
21:52:10 <Runbunny> That is true.
21:52:15 <Camail> these guys just need to have a better loot filter
21:52:27 <Camail> it just shows how bad most people are at speed clearing
21:52:54 <Runbunny> But having thick white fog and having white lighting you have to look out for is kinda...
21:53:13 <Runbunny> Also everything explodes.
21:53:19 <carcinisation> sounds spooky
21:53:36 <Camail> there's two ways to do it, either go slow and kill everything in front of you, or blast trhough everything and naturally dodge all the tracking stuff
21:53:49 <Camail> the only thing that explodes that actually hurts is the white VD
21:54:07 <Camail> just donst step on the pustules, but DO step on the melons
21:54:19 <Camail> when i had no damage i did delirium pretty slow
21:54:24 <Runbunny> I also didn't know that the delirium ramps the further away from the start you get.
21:54:35 <Camail> yea that's the major conceit

21:54:55 <Camail> its normal to just do hald the map as delirium and skip the rest
21:54:59 <Camail> half*
21:56:13 <Runbunny> The effect that rare mobs get looks pretty cool though
21:56:22 <DuB`> Turning strim back on because talking to the air is p fun
21:56:34 <Runbunny> The head just splits in half while a guy comes out and kills you.
21:56:56 <Camail> yea that thing is crazy

21:57:24 <Runbunny> O:
21:57:47 <Runbunny> How to play the delirium league in 1 easy step
21:58:03 <Runbunny> "If you are standing anywhere -> move to somewhere else"
21:58:13 <Runbunny> repeat every frame of the game.
21:58:24 <Camail> thats a good lesson for the entire game

23:45:48 <Runbunny> So apparently... I don't have to apply for jobs while this thing is going on.
23:46:22 <Runbunny> However the lady on the phone this thursday told me that I still had to do so...
