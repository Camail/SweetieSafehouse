08:37:34 <Dot|Phone> Cane. What is this gunslinger mod for stalker, first I've heard of it but it seems anticipated. 
08:40:47 <Cane> Gunslinger is one of those pipe dream mods that has been in development by like one or two dudes for about three years now.
08:41:07 <Cane> Once in a while they release a new video of something cool they've done, everyone goes "I wish I had that RIGHT NOW", and then they disappear for another 6 months.
08:41:35 <Cane> It's super ambitious, which is the problem.
08:47:15 <Dot|Phone> Knew you would know. 
08:49:30 <Dot|Phone> Well, now I want to play stalker again... Dam that game

09:29:55 <Runbunny> But there is like one hour till I can eat and my clothes aren't fully dry either.
09:30:26 <Dot|Phone> But runbun, you washed those yesterday
09:32:10 <Rawr|Phone> Well, he is in denmark dot
09:32:41 <Runbunny> Indeed.
09:33:36 <Runbunny> My dryer is a flimsy metal scaffolding where clothes can hang passively dry off.

10:36:03 <Dot|Phone> Why is the USA being silly again
10:36:13 <Micen>  What are we doing now?
10:36:42 <Micen> one of my resolutions is to not focus so much on politics myself. 
10:36:47 <Dot|Phone> Blowing up ppl in other countries
10:38:05 <Micen> i kind of assume that is always happening, regardless of if it gets reported. 
10:38:56 <Dot|Phone> Well this time it was a very important and liked figure in Iran
10:42:41 <reification> a wise resolution
10:47:16 <reification> dot us foreign policy has been "not agreement capable" for many years as the russians put it
10:47:26 <reification> set your expectations accordingly 
10:52:46 <Micen> we are very capable of agreement. When it is on our terms and our terms alone.

11:04:11 <carcinisation> micen the term doesn't mean uncapable of making agreements but keeping them over time e.g. iran nuclear deal
11:05:02 <carcinisation> maliciousness is not implied but typically the replacement of people who then will not honour previous agreements
