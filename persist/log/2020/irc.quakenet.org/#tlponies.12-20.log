00:20:36 <Dot`> hows all doing
00:22:05 <Runbunny> Dot.
00:22:13 <skram> Dot.
00:22:26 <Dot`> angel, jonas
00:22:36 <Dot`> scandanavian friends
00:22:55 <skram> I bought shoes today Dot`
00:23:42 <Dot`> are they fancy?
00:24:02 <skram> No?
00:24:06 <skram> bit expensive i guess
00:25:34 <Dot`> how many holes they got?
00:25:39 <Runbunny> Practical good boots?
00:25:52 <skram> just the hole for my foot
00:25:58 <Dot`> great
00:26:39 <skram> i wouldnt buy non-practical footwear anders
00:28:29 <Runbunny> That is what I thought.
00:40:30 <skram> did you see haachama eat a spider runbun
00:41:03 <DuB`> I felt sick seeing those pictures
00:41:56 <skram> hahah
00:42:04 <skram> she's pretty badass tbh
00:46:28 <skram> would you eat a tarantula DuB`?
00:46:54 <DuB`> nu
00:48:07 <skram> yeah me neither
00:48:16 <skram> if only we were as strong as haachama
01:06:04 <Dot`> one day skram, i believe in you
01:10:00 <skram> thanks buddy
01:10:26 <DuB`> I dunno if "more like haachama" is something to aspire to
01:10:40 <Dot`> i try not to judge skrams dreams
01:11:27 <skram> I think everyone should be a bit more like haachama
01:11:35 <skram> she doesnt afraid of anything
01:22:26 <Dot`> runbun, hob is doing ok in this run it seems
01:33:13 <Dot`> F
01:37:02 <Runbunny> Hehe.
01:37:07 <Runbunny> skram, I did.
01:37:53 <Runbunny> I'd wish that whoever is doing it would release the curse on Haato already.
01:47:26 <skram> this is the superior version
01:50:24 <Runbunny> Mayhaps. But I miss the cozy minecraft stream from like a year ago.
01:52:57 <Runbunny> Streams.
01:53:05 <Runbunny> Anyhoo I should probably sleep.
01:53:11 <skram> same
01:53:14 <Runbunny> Shark is singing though.
01:53:26 <Dot`> gnight bun, skram
01:53:35 <skram> ye but christmas songs make me uncomfortable
01:53:37 <Runbunny> Goodnight Bjørn.
01:53:52 <Runbunny> Open your heart Jonas.
01:54:07 <skram> doors were welded shut years ago, andersen
01:54:09 <Runbunny> Reclaim your childhood innocence.
03:55:20 <Camail> DuB`  "Removed the memory_pool_budgets.csv file"
03:55:27 <Camail> it was all placebo
03:55:38 <Camail> i bet that guy feels dumb now
03:55:53 <DuB`> Yeah haha
03:56:07 <DuB`> I saw some comment mentioned he'd doubled down and was trying to defend himself, pretty hilarious
03:56:29 <Camail> oof
03:56:45 <Camail> you cant argue with a dev's direct statement
03:56:53 <Camail> unless you're just saying they're lying to save face

20:22:01 <Camail> so i did all the cyberpsychos and its literally just a pat on the back, so far
20:22:15 <Camail> maybe later something meaningful happens but i kind of doubt it
20:25:09 <Golly> havent gotten anything else, no
20:26:09 <skram> Runbunny is that cgi
20:27:22 <Golly> also performance for me has gotten worse with every patch, lul
20:32:55 <Runbunny> No clue Jonas... Are you getting inspiration?
20:33:47 <skram> I dont know if you could pay Rolls Royce enough money to replace the spirit of ecstacy with 02
20:36:46 <Dot`> skram, cam, kill some zombies?
20:37:13 <skram> sure, but only a few
