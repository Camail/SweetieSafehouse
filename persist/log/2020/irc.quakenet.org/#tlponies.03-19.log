19:45:29 <Runbunny> Camail, How would you feel about a fighting where the framerate was tied to the round clock?

19:45:44 <Camail> i would feel bad
19:45:55 <Camail> because in fighting games framerate is tired to animation
19:46:18 <Camail> so either you change the speed of the game or you decouple fps from animations and all fgc knowledge kinda faulters
19:46:34 <Camail> tied*

22:22:07 <Dot`> see, they are great
22:26:37 <carcinisation> good enough to star in multiple animes this season dot
22:28:05 <Dot`> that sentence worries me
22:28:52 <skram> dont worry
22:28:56 <skram> its all very wholesome
22:29:42 <Dot`> i know this to be a lie skram, becuase ealier mention of hyenas was met with mention of a certain reviewers anime
22:30:48 <skram> whats un-wholesome about sleeping with prostitutes and then writing about it
22:34:54 <Dot`> look, you keep your degenaracy, i was just trying to say that heynas are in top tier animal list
22:44:15 <Bio> Did someone say degeneracy

23:20:25 <Camail> Runbunny  ggg is changing the delirium vd to not explode instantly on impact
23:20:55 <Camail> gotta admit, that was a weird choice to make them literally undodgable other than just outrunning them
23:22:18 <Runbunny> Yeah, it's odd.
23:26:43 <Camail> unlike normal monster vd this one slows down and is very easy to run away from, but still it can really mess you up if you're not paying attention
23:27:04 <Camail> gotta be entirely proactive instead of reactive
