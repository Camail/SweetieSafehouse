13:58:54 <Rawr|Fone> Reef reef!
13:58:58 <reification> roar roar!
14:09:12 <skram> so i have a room thats uninsulated and poorly sealed attached to my house where i keep the firewood right
14:10:24 <skram> and since its marginally warmer than the outside, mice come in and chill out and try to eat things, however, the previous tenant let a bunch of poison so when i went in there it was a frickin mouse graveyard
14:11:36 <reification> D:
14:11:47 <Dot`> :/
14:12:50 <skram> Maybe I should make a lil decoy house where they can live instead so i dont get the plague
14:14:24 <Dot`> make a nice little mouse house?
14:15:18 <reification> yes https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/4141259
14:16:04 <skram> would be nice
14:16:14 <skram> but mice carry hantavirus
14:19:19 <Dot`> so a mouse hospital?
14:23:14 <Cane> A mousepital?

19:13:07 <Runbunny> skram, I played video games and hung out on discord.
19:13:31 <Runbunny> I did also watch some streams I guess.
19:14:52 <Runbunny> Plus watched a press conference since the corona infection is currently rising a lot in Denmark.

20:38:26 <Camail> god, the new hades song is so good
20:38:44 <Camail> i didnt have a chance to listen to it during the fight because you would die for sure
20:40:20 <Camail> it was 5 diamonds to unlock and i'll never actually play it at home cuz its so damn loud
20:47:03 <Camail> i think super giant might be the best studio in the world? Like, they are so important, their design practices are so important
20:47:31 <Camail> all 4 of their major releases have gone to the greatest lengths to tie every aspect of the game to its mechanics
20:49:52 <Camail> i've never seen a company embrace the medium as much as they do
20:50:33 <Dot`> Klei is up there too i think
20:54:25 <Camail> yea, they're really good
