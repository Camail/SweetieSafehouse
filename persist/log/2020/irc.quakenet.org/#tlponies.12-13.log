00:05:36 <DuB`> My new worst bug yet is jumping off of a 3-foot high rock and insta-dying from full hp
00:05:46 <DuB`> Badlands are dangerous!
00:23:48 <Camail> that almost happened to me
00:24:01 <Camail> i got stuck on a pipe somehow and kept taking damage
00:24:12 <Camail> spammed medpacks and jump until i got out
00:24:25 <Camail> this city is trying to eat you
01:09:09 <DuB`> How poetically appropriate
01:39:47 <Camail> snipers from militech have normal snipers, if you're still looking
01:40:02 <DuB`> Ya, got one o those
01:40:04 <DuB`> KaBOOM
01:40:11 <DuB`> Saw a 50k headshot hehe
01:57:06 <DuB`> Just realized I have 270 heal thingies
01:57:13 <DuB`> lootgoblin-ing
02:04:26 <Camail> I STOPPED PICKING THME UP, MOSTLY
02:04:35 <Camail> caps is my scanner key
02:08:32 <Camail> its mostly because early game i picked up every green for parts, but since i stopped picking up greens i also kinda just ignore the health too

18:10:59 <Dot`> but he got FO done at least
18:11:26 <Runbunny> Yeah, he might actually pull the bet off after all.
18:11:46 <reification> all hinges on god run 2
18:13:10 <Runbunny> Yes. Just like Hob intended.
18:13:52 <Dot`> what is game 12? is it dishonoured?

22:12:20 <reification> bio https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eo-ExP5XEAQTWpT?format=jpg&name=medium
22:19:10 <Camail> steam says 65 so probably 55
22:24:44 <Runbunny> Dang.
22:25:06 <Runbunny> Anyhoo, it's time to sleep.
22:25:11 <skram> godnat
22:25:36 <Runbunny> Godnat Jonas.
22:26:56 <Camail> yea, i get sucked into narratives
22:27:05 <Camail> hit some main story end points too soon so had to slow down
22:27:11 <Camail> felt like i was rushing
22:27:58 <Camail> side jobs are hella elaborate sometimes, and gigs have enough meat on their bones to be satisfying
22:28:28 <Camail> its been very fun to play a good old fashion rpg again
22:28:44 <Camail> this one's even more rpg than witcher, by a country mile
22:30:04 <skram> fantastic
22:30:10 <skram> hows keanu reeves
22:31:05 <Camail> handled well
22:31:27 <Camail> do you know the jist of what he is
22:31:36 <Camail> cuz its hard to talk about if you're 100% blind
22:32:04 <skram> not at all
22:32:25 <Camail> but all in all, its keanu, as a performer he doesn't have those tall peaks of emotion
22:32:42 <Camail> so sometime he's a bit flat, but 90% of the time its good
22:33:39 <skram> Ive not watched any gameplay related videos of the game at all
22:33:41 <skram> wanna go in fresh
22:33:53 <Camail> even with the bugs i'd recommend the game
22:34:09 <skram> yeah
22:34:23 <skram> just hope it runs decently well on my computer
22:34:37 <Camail> ironically its cpu bottlenecked for me
22:34:55 <Camail> big crowds, post processing, stuff like that
22:36:07 <Camail> oh, just hit max street cred, boo
22:36:31 <Camail> i think everyone i kill at this level scaling is worth stupid amounts of street cred 
22:36:59 <Camail> also, dont play this game in puvlib
22:37:04 <Camail> random nudity everywhere
22:37:29 <skram> I dont understand how cpu specs work anymore
22:38:21 <skram> The recommended spec is a 4790, i got a 8700 which has more cores but lower base frequency
22:39:23 <skram> but surely its better? how much? what does turbo frequency even mean
22:41:11 <Camail> i think turbo is overclocking done by them
22:41:44 <skram> So like the turbo button I had on my pentium 2 in 1999
22:41:45 <Camail> is 4790 intel and 8700 amd
22:41:51 <skram> no they're both intel
22:41:57 <Camail> wtf intel why
22:42:23 <Camail> i think mine is 3.8 ghz
22:42:36 <skram> i dont understand the nomenclature
22:42:41 <Camail> 3.5
22:42:52 <Camail> i dont either
22:42:57 <Camail> but i doubt you'll have a problem
22:43:07 <Camail> the game doesnt need a beast to be ably to run and look decent
22:43:22 <skram> good
22:43:29 <Camail> people are having problems on ps4 because lol ps4
22:43:36 <Camail> this game wasnt made for that console and we know it
22:44:01 <Camail> the internet can suck a bag of dicks, it was never gonna be a relevant place to actually judge this game
22:44:30 <Camail> have appropriate expectations, and play how ya want, and you'll enjoy it
22:44:55 <skram> sounds pretty limiting trying to make a game run well on a 7 year old system anyway
22:58:26 <Camail> the one thing that is odd to me is that you dont get xp or street cred by non lethally stopping someone
22:58:38 <Camail> but like, a lot of my stuff kind of incidentally doesnt kill
22:58:59 <Camail> so i have to go around blasting heads off people on the ground if i want progression 
22:59:13 <Camail> which is fine, but i very often forget
23:09:41 <Dot`> you got to be more murdery cam
23:10:11 <Camail> only when i'm attentive
23:11:24 <Camail> oh fuck there's a 225k car
23:11:32 <Camail> ugh, do i grind for it tho

23:26:34 <Camail> the answer is no, its numbers arent worth it
23:35:13 <reification> can't you steal it?
23:38:12 <Camail> nope, there's a subset of cars that are legit purchases
23:38:22 <Camail> also there are better cars than that one
23:39:45 <Camail> hmmm, i have a complaint about the game that sounds horrifying without context
23:39:53 <Camail> i wont say it, but know that my brow is furrowed
23:40:21 <Camail> and that historical accuracy would have made this mission much more impactful 
23:41:21 <reification> ok i shall try imagining the subset of game complaints too horrifying for you to utter
23:42:13 <Camail> thanks
