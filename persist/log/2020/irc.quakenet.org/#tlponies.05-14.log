20:18:37 <Camail> Runbunny  yea i saw that, was pretty funny
20:18:57 <Camail> all of a sudden they are doing the games with good netcode
20:19:06 <Camail> JP devs are losing so much money
20:19:21 <Camail> serves them right, their higher ups are fucking brain dead
20:19:29 <Runbunny> Hopefully then they will commit to proper netcode.
20:19:44 <Camail> literally, all i can do is hope
20:19:47 <Camail> like...fuck
20:21:14 <Runbunny> It's mind boggling that fan made fixes exists and the actual devs have no clue.

22:00:00 <Camail> it was build int he same engine
22:00:18 <Camail> it shares a lot of design philosophy, but actual execution is quite different
22:00:44 <Camail> instead of infinite protection and undizzy being burt mecahnics, they prefer to increase gravity like in mvc 2
22:00:53 <Camail> very combo and mix up heavy
