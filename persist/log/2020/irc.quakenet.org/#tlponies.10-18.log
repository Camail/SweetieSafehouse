00:00:40 <Dot`> the poison can be nasty though
00:02:19 <skram> yeah
00:02:43 <skram> but even if it takes you 2 seconds to get to the cure you've already taken like 10 damage
00:03:21 <Dot`> i really like deflect dash
00:03:38 <skram> yeah deflect is godly
00:03:54 <skram> especially against those ranged things in asphodel
00:04:51 <Dot`> pink wave things?
00:05:12 <Dot`> or the guys that throw pots
00:05:28 <skram> No those floaty bois that throw orbs in a cone
00:05:36 <Dot`> oh those
00:05:41 <Dot`> yea
00:05:47 <skram> if you have more than 2 on a map it starts getting real hard to dodge em

15:14:41 <Rawr|Fone> So majestic
15:14:45 <Rawr|Fone> The dub
15:14:57 <Dot`> Rawr, my eye is sore but i went for a nice walk earlier
15:15:01 <Dot`> so some good, some bad
15:15:11 <Dot`> now tell me how you are doing
15:15:15 <DuB`> Behold me
15:15:21 <DuB`> Dot what'd you do to your eyeball
15:15:41 <Rawr|Fone> Pretty good dot, rest day today so I haven't been doing much
15:15:50 <Rawr|Fone> Some work for the project tomorrow
15:16:09 <Dot`> dub its just a dumb eye that gets sore and causes megrains
15:16:14 <Dot`> i should probably remove it
15:16:17 <Dot`> and become a pirate
15:16:23 <Micen> pluck it out. 
15:17:26 <Dot`> Dub, you escaped hades already?
15:17:33 <Dot`> easy game?
15:18:18 <DuB`> Shield OP
15:18:42 <Dot`> shield build? i have had nice runs but not founs a super good combo for it yet
15:19:00 <Dot`> a charge build of some kind?
15:19:06 <DuB`> Temporary boon for -50% hp but 4 hp heal per hit is dumb
15:19:13 <DuB`> I just face tanked everything from that point on
15:19:24 <Dot`> oh, i havnt seen that one
15:19:47 <DuB`> Also had boon to convert casts to laser turrets and they did most of my dps
15:20:28 <Dot`> intristing
15:21:02 <Dot`> ive still only won with the bow, there is a charge upgrade for Q with extra shots
15:21:10 <Dot`> i just dashed up to ppl and tapped Q
15:21:21 <DuB`> Nice, haven't tried bow
15:21:21 <Dot`> things died, even hades in a few seconds
15:21:31 <DuB`> Waow haha
15:21:38 <Dot`> the true easy way
15:21:46 <DuB`> Fully poseidon'ed-out shield is silly, knocking things across the map and exploding them against walls
15:21:59 <DuB`> Not so good for bosses tho
15:22:03 <Dot`> ive had that once, its great fun
15:25:14 <DuB`> (My god mode dmg resistance is at about 40% now, mind you)
15:27:03 <Dot`> oh, well thats cheating dub
15:27:04 <Dot`> haha
15:31:06 <DuB`> Hey, it's not my fault that witches are in the game
15:31:11 <DuB`> Freakin witches...
15:31:32 <Dot`> witches? what are those again
15:31:56 <DuB`> Lil run-away purple blob projectile spamming jerks
15:32:26 <Dot`> oh, dash deflect is best
15:32:32 <Dot`> bop them back
15:41:00 <DuB`> .choose monhun, hades

20:20:57 <skram> i made it to hades, Dot`
20:21:08 <skram> you have to kill him twice and thats cheating
20:22:09 <Dot`> ikr?
20:23:01 <Runbunny> Dot`, whens Hob?
20:23:09 <Runbunny> Also nicely done Jonas.
20:24:02 <Dot`> runbun, should be soon
20:34:08 <Runbunny> I have evening shifts all next week. So should be perfect for watching some Hob.
20:34:52 <Dot`> nice
20:37:12 <Dot`> now all you need is for hob to actually stream
20:37:37 <reification> https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/4157028
20:41:13 <Runbunny> That might be the hardest part
20:53:23 <Runbunny> Oh there he is.
20:53:49 <Dot`> now he stalls for half an hour before starting any runs
20:54:06 <Dot`> tsk tsk, this is why a french guy got the god run 2 first
20:54:55 <Runbunny> You'll have to admit that Hob's stalling skills are out of this world.
20:55:18 <Dot`> all he has to do is no hit stalling
