01:22:10 <Runbunny> DuB`, Have you experienced monhun dropping your inputs?
01:25:11 <DuB`> Hm
01:25:44 <DuB`> I've noticed some awkwardness with trying to buffer or quickly chain shield/attack inputs with lance. Nothing on other weapons

01:43:24 <Runbunny> For some reason I find the timing for chaining charged shells kinda strict, too fast, nothing comes out, too slow it's normal shell.
