00:36:24 <DuB`> Now am hamborger
00:36:31 <Dot`> do you not have clothes?
00:36:36 <Dot`> have you been going to work naked?
00:37:03 <skram> is that what business casual is
00:37:10 <DuB`> pls
00:37:14 <DuB`> Style is 4ever
00:41:33 <Dot`> dub always dresses in style
00:42:09 <Runbunny> But does he style in dresses ?!?!

00:47:44 <Dot`> gnight bun
00:47:49 <DuB`> Sleep is booooring
00:48:01 <Runbunny> Clearly you haven't slept at all.
00:51:19 <Dot`> dub
00:51:26 <Dot`> its friday, why you eating a burger
00:52:33 <DuB`> Because is late

00:54:23 <Dot`> bio, now its 4 pizzas
00:56:22 <Rial> Send me a pizza
00:59:25 <skram> i will send you a whole pizza if you send me a takoyaki rial
01:01:37 <Dot`> is this sometihng you have seen in your animes skram?
01:02:01 <Rial> lol
01:02:17 <skram> pff no
01:02:28 <DuB`> 1 pizza for 1 takoyaki doesn't quite seem a fair trade
01:02:31 <skram> ...it was in one of my cooking mangas and it looked delicious ok
01:03:04 <Dot`> doesnt all food look good in animes?
01:03:47 <Rial> https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/168312-takoyaki-batter
01:03:59 <Rial> Look look, make batter, and you can even fill it with bacon and cheese
01:04:26 <Dot`> are they just dough balls?
01:04:38 <Dot`> with some stuff mixed into the batter
01:04:42 <DuB`> No they have tako
01:04:54 <skram> taako?
01:04:54 <DuB`> And then you yaku
01:05:19 <Dot`> YAK
01:05:29 <DuB`> Yakimasu
01:05:35 <Rial> tako is octopus -- but the little spices and things added to the batter are just for GENUINE takoyaki... y'know. I made simple batter like that and used cheese and ham instead, and it's pretty good
01:05:36 <skram> I cant find dashi anywhere, rial
01:05:49 <skram> or the things you need to make it
01:05:57 <Rial> ah, not even on the INTERNET?
01:06:17 <skram> well im sure amazon has it at extortionate prices
01:06:19 <Dot`> dark web dashi
01:06:42 <DuB`> Download some dashi
01:07:09 <Dot`> you wouldnt download a bear
01:07:26 <skram> what would i even do with a bear
01:07:34 <DuB`> Make stew
01:07:36 <Dot`> hug
01:07:44 <skram> in that order
01:08:19 <Dot`> :O
01:08:44 <skram> after Dot` smuggled chocolate from England im kinda worried about foodstuffs through customs Rial
01:09:04 <Rial> What happened?
01:09:12 <Dot`> what they gonna do? arrest me?
01:09:21 <skram> maybe??
01:10:08 <Rial> Put chocolate between a towel =w= that's how I sent two iPhones to my home country for my friend to sell $$$$$$
01:10:35 <skram> i ordered some chocolate in bulk to dot in england so he could ship it to me but the post office didnt wanna i think
01:10:35 <DuB`> Ah yes, the ultime anti-xray countermeasure
01:10:36 <skram> was a hassle
01:10:42 <skram> i sent some socks in return
01:10:54 <Dot`> they are great socks
01:11:00 <Rial> socks are always nice
01:11:16 <Dot`> hand knitted socks!
01:11:34 <Rial> cat bread, come visit japan for cat bread https://jouhou.nagoya/nekoneko-shokupan-sakae/
01:11:35 <skram> not by me, obviously
01:11:51 <skram> made from merino wool which is...softer? dunno
01:12:05 <Rial> hand knitted socks! the best
01:12:05 <Dot`> rial, with real cat?
01:12:14 <skram> you make a compelling argument rial
01:12:21 <DuB`> Worth it to go to japan just for melonpan
01:12:21 <Rial> authentic bread with authentic real 100% cats
01:12:51 <skram> whats up with japan and melons rial
01:12:55 <skram> and why are they somtimes square
01:13:11 <Dot`> packing efficiency
01:13:26 <skram> good point
01:13:30 <Rial> hmm, I never ate a squareish melonpan
01:14:12 <Rial> What's the purpose of a squareish melonpan... they're called melonpan because they look like melons :s making it square defeats the name D:
01:14:17 <DuB`> Good melons are fancy gift sorts of things there
01:14:23 <DuB`> Squarish melons, not pan!
01:14:35 <Rial> oh, I see
01:15:00 <DuB`> These sorta https://www.atlasobscura.com/foods/square-watermelons-japan
01:15:01 <Rial> My brain needed further detailing
01:15:11 <Rial> Ahh, it's a gift, yeah~ 
01:15:16 <Rial> Just like cat bread
01:15:40 <skram> hmm if I leave in 4 hours I can get to tokyo and back again for like 450 euro
01:15:43 <skram> why is it so cheap
01:16:01 <Rial> Maybe it's cheaper because of the virus going around?
01:16:23 <Rial> The media is causing people to freak out
01:17:09 <DuB`> My best is $740, skram
01:17:14 <Dot`> skram, that reminds me, we need to go to the faroe islands, they look nice
01:17:16 <DuB`> ... with 5 hours in hong kong
01:18:01 <skram> uh oh
01:18:20 <Rial> I'm leaving in 10 min. Will eat lunch somewhere in Nagoya, and then walk around until it's time for my psych appointment
01:18:27 <Rial> Have a good morning, all
01:18:33 <Dot`> later rial <3
01:18:33 <DuB`> glhf
01:18:34 <skram> cheers rial
01:18:38 <DuB`> Good ol' nagoya
01:18:39 <Rial> Thanks for the talk
01:18:55 <skram> <3
01:19:36 <DuB`> I lived in 昭和区 of Nagoya for a while, Rial :D
01:20:00 <skram> its pretty nice Dot`, but theres not a whole lot to do
01:20:02 <DuB`> Also 天白区
01:20:03 <skram> lots of sheep
01:20:12 <Dot`> have you been there?
01:20:14 <skram> moonrunes
01:20:16 <skram> what a mystery
01:20:24 <skram> naw dot
01:20:27 <DuB`> Lots of walks and hikes, I imagine
01:20:31 <skram> but its TINY
01:20:42 <Dot`> its also DANISH
01:20:47 <skram> also its danish
01:20:48 <skram> haha
01:20:50 <DuB`> Yum
01:20:58 <Dot`> lol
01:21:47 <skram> also theres a lot of sheep
01:23:37 <Dot`> skram, what was the dat for you moving in again?
01:24:00 <skram> 17th of march
01:24:31 <Dot`> just over a month to go
01:25:06 <skram> very exciting
01:25:28 <Dot`> is your current renting furnished?
01:25:42 <skram> got 14 days or so to put new floors down, paint all the things, move all my shit, and wash the old apt
01:25:51 <skram> partly
01:26:05 <Dot`> new floors?
01:26:07 <skram> i need fridge/stove/etc
01:26:15 <Dot`> thats not too expensive i hope
01:26:22 <Dot`> and a stove?
01:26:29 <Dot`> are stoves not inbuilt?
01:26:38 <skram> not always
01:27:36 <skram> i got some cheap laminate flooring from a guy on a mountain
01:27:53 <skram> oh and i need a shower cabinet
01:28:11 <skram> and just some misc stuff to make it look less lonely i guess since its twice the size of my current place
01:29:04 <Dot`> a shower? do ppl just take thier stoves and showers with them when they move?
01:31:16 <skram> well alright, the current shower is just a corner where they shower straight onto the tiles, and since its fairly old at this point the technical inspector guy had doubts about the water membrane so in order not to make the frames rot im gonna but in a cabinet and use that until i have enough monies to redo the flooring in the bathroom
01:34:09 <Dot`> hmm
01:37:34 <skram> lots of work to be done D:
01:41:21 <Dot`> you going to do any of the stuff yourself?
01:41:55 <skram> all of it hopefully
01:42:02 <Dot`> my one uncle who is a structural engineer designed his house, then a few years later designed the extension and build the whole thing himself
01:44:59 <skram> carpentry is just lego with a bit more options i think
01:49:30 <Dot`> houses in SA are brick
01:50:17 <Dot`> tile roofs, but the supports are wood and window frames normaly i guess
01:50:55 <skram> brick houses would be pretty cold i'd imagine
01:52:09 <Dot`> normaly i guess
01:52:36 <Dot`> except in the hight of summer when all the walls are heated up
01:52:44 <Dot`> and its still 26 degrees at night
01:52:51 <Dot`> and the walls are radiating heat still
01:52:54 <skram> oof
02:12:10 <Camail> Dot`  go to sleep!
02:12:14 <Camail> skram can stay up
02:12:17 <Camail> he's been a good boy
02:12:28 <skram> yass
02:13:42 <Camail> we should all live in your new house
02:14:03 <skram> who gets to use the bed
02:14:28 <Camail> hmm, i dunno
02:14:36 <Camail> we could hold weekly competitions of various kinds
02:14:56 <Camail> i'd need to get back in shape...
02:16:29 <skram> good idea
02:16:37 <skram> round is a shape, right?
02:22:11 <Camail> there are better shapes
02:22:20 <Camail> like a rhombus 
02:22:25 <Camail> or a helix
02:22:33 <Camail> optimal spine configurations
02:22:57 <skram> ah yes, the helix
02:23:01 <skram> the peak of physical fitness

12:28:29 <Dot`> hi friend
12:28:47 <Dot`> what you up to
12:29:49 <Rial> Psych appointment was a success. Got a letter I can show the police in case someone reports me of üsing the wrong bathroom"
12:29:52 <Rial> "using*
12:30:29 <skram> hell yeah
12:30:44 <skram> how was lunch?
12:30:51 <Dot`> nice
12:31:22 <Rial> Lunch was great. We went to a cool cheap place with good food. Everyone knows it's that, so the waiting line was 1 hour lol
12:33:51 <skram> yikes
12:33:53 <skram> what'd you eat D:
12:38:44 <Rial> I'll put it on discord

12:42:35 <Rial> yeee, it was delicious!!
12:46:08 <Rawr|Fone> 🐴🐴🐴
12:47:43 <skram> well now im hungry too
12:47:47 <skram> is that soup in the teacup?
12:47:56 <Rial> yeah!
12:49:02 <skram> thats kinda wacky
12:49:28 <Dot`> CW?
12:49:56 <Rial> CW means Content Warning
12:50:41 <Rial> For sensitive content that can be uncomfortable for some. It's a thing I learned in the fediverse
12:54:59 <skram> whats the fediverse?
12:56:52 <Rial> the fediverse is the name of connected instances using a few systems. The most famous system within the fediverse is Mastodon
12:58:44 <skram> open source social network huh
12:58:45 <skram> neat
12:59:14 <Rial> It's an alternative to Twitter. It's main attraction is that it is not a company - this means No capitalism, No privacy breach, And user content ownership. An amalgamation of connected social circles, each with different focus.
13:01:17 <skram> that seems like a pretty good idea actually
13:02:58 <Dot`> so a fancy IRC?
13:04:42 <Rial> It's kind of hard to define what it is... It's a mix of Twitter, Discord, and IRC?

13:07:36 <Rial> https://yiff.life/@PurrPurin <-- my profile and feed. I'm in YiffLife. (Despite its name, the focus isn't porn :P) The instance I'm in says it's oriented towards those in the furry and LGBTQIA+ communities, so I found a home there, for my personal catharsis and silly jokes
13:09:50 <skram> i dont know rial, if your pudding makes purring noises i'd be slightly worried
13:10:16 <Rial> You got my name, yeah! That's what I went by before deciding on my name, Rial =w=
13:11:14 <Rial> A few things I like the fediverse by: No quoted retweets (so dunking and dogpiling is discouraged), No ads, Content Warnings, and admins/mods are real people (instead of an automated robot system)
13:13:23 <skram> so it feels a bit more like a small-ish community?
13:14:59 <skram> i made purin a buncha times because i found a way easy recipe in a manga...
13:15:22 <Rial> Yes, it does, but also, it doesn't. You have access to different timelines, a local one for your instance, and the federated one, that shows the " friends of your friends" instances. Account creation is per instance
13:16:06 <carcinisation> it is a far more healthy model
13:16:30 <skram> indeed
13:20:47 <Rial> I like it =w=
13:27:10 <carcinisation> time to report us all to the police for hacking https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EQuhN1WW4AEhoCw.jpg
