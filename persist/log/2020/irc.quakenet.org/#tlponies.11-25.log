12:05:54 <Dot|Phone> You happy with it? 
12:06:59 <Rawr|Fone> It's good enough for a first release, but I think there is a lot that can be done to improve it
12:07:13 <Dot|Phone> Hmm. So often the case
12:07:51 <Rawr|Fone> Indeed
12:08:00 <Rawr|Fone> Always something more that you could do
13:04:39 <Dot|Phone> No Reif and no skram
13:04:46 <Dot|Phone> What's happened Rawr
13:08:00 <Rawr|Fone> Skram was here for 15 minutes this morning

15:20:07 <Dot|Phone> Reif, have you listened to the goons show? I'm feeling alone in this
15:20:08 <reification> i have been informed about an exciting new source of pies :D https://trufflesrestaurantfareham.co.uk/take-away/
15:20:50 <reification> that's an old one dotties
15:21:02 <Dot|Phone> It is
15:21:12 <Dot|Phone> But classic
15:22:00 <reification> i know my dad is big fan but he would have been right time for the original broadcast
15:22:31 <Dot|Phone> I think Reif just called me old
15:23:47 <reification> well i think lysistrata is best comedy play so how old would that make me :p
