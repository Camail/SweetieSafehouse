14:17:50 <Dot|Phone> How's you
14:17:58 <Rawr|Fone> I played more hades today
14:18:09 <Dot|Phone> More winning? 
14:18:28 <Rawr|Fone> I have beaten him with all the weapons now
14:18:39 <Dot|Phone> Wow 
14:18:49 <Dot|Phone> How many runs you done? 
14:19:38 <Rawr|Fone> About 25 I think
14:19:43 <Rawr|Fone> A little less than 30
14:19:50 <Dot|Phone> That's not very many
14:20:17 <Dot|Phone> Gj horse 
14:21:35 <Rawr|Fone> I think you just have to learn the boss fights
14:21:49 <Rawr|Fone> Hades is very easy to see what he is going to do
14:23:21 <Dot|Phone> Hmm. Second phase just gets me. 
14:25:34 <Rawr|Fone> Getting more dashes from the mirror and then getting hermes to give you more dashes makes it pretty easy to dodge his attacks
14:25:49 <Rawr|Fone> And if you have the shield, you can block those lasers he does
14:26:05 <Rawr|Fone> The shield was really easy when I figured oit how to use it
14:26:09 <Rawr|Fone> Out
14:26:56 <Rawr|Fone> With the fist weapon, I just stacked a bunch of those boons that damage enemies around you when you take damage
14:27:04 <Rawr|Fone> And hades pretty much killed himself
14:35:43 <Dot|Phone> Lol. Nice

19:08:42 <skram> Camail
19:08:43 <skram> hello
19:08:46 <skram> DuB`
19:08:47 <skram> pls
19:09:42 <Camail> hi
19:36:56 <Dot`> cam
19:37:11 <Camail> dot
21:47:38 <Dot`> Runbunny, is hob taking mroe days off?
21:47:48 <Runbunny> I am unsure.
21:48:22 <Runbunny> I think he took a day off.
21:48:49 <Runbunny> I should take a day off as well. On like tuesday or something.
21:59:18 <Camail> ok so i think i dont hate dota as an esport, i just got into it at the wrong time
21:59:33 <Camail> because everything is one sided as fuck and the games are boring 95% of the time
21:59:42 <Camail> but i remember that not being the case, so it must be a meta thing
21:59:52 <Camail> so its just that this patch sucks?
22:00:50 <Camail> i cant click on a stream, see someone 10k up at 30 minutes and then be told to care
22:05:39 <reification> new patch is badly needed
22:07:21 <reification> should be mid month
22:07:23 <Camail> i like pangolin boy, he's neat
22:07:36 <Camail> but sven puts me to sleep
22:08:27 <Camail> faceless void is fun to watch
22:08:32 <reification> sven and spec should be getting chunky nerf
22:12:28 <reification> having a cool ulti is very important: enigma, necro etc.
22:15:05 <DuB`> Right now is often PA and Sven it seems, big bursty carries who just kinda right click on things very hard
22:15:13 <DuB`> Also Nigma lost >:(
22:19:47 <Camail> but... liquid
22:19:59 <Camail> arent you a liquid guy
22:47:55 <DuB`> Nigma is old liquid, and I am fan
23:40:09 <reification> skram https://twitter.com/AnimalsWorId/status/1335050382033088512
23:43:07 <Camail> uh oh, DuB`  is a dota boomer
23:43:50 <DuB`> GH and Kuroky are best guys
23:43:57 <DuB`> That's all that matters
23:44:01 <Camail> out with old liquid, in with old alliance
