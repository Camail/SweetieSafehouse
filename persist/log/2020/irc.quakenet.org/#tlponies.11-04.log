19:38:34 <Dot`> Cam, all caught up on CR now
19:38:37 <Dot`> this is aweful
19:45:34 <reification> start watching vtubers dot then you’ll never run out
19:48:16 <skram> how you holdin up Camail
19:50:20 <Camail> life is a constant hellscape
19:50:39 <Camail> i never want to see a map again
19:51:41 <DuB`> Might as well move: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201104001311.htm
19:51:48 <DuB`> Not to big of a change
19:51:52 <DuB`> too*
19:52:02 <Camail> too red for my taste
19:52:26 <DuB`> In that case, NY is nice :P
19:52:53 <Camail> i live in IL, which is equally as blue
19:53:32 <Camail> but i won't lie, regardless of the election results, Scandinavia looks nice
19:53:33 <DuB`> 5000 km/hr winds at 3000C sounds so exciting, are you sure?
19:53:45 <Camail> well it would solve my anxiety
19:53:53 <Camail> but i dunno how sustainable it is
19:53:59 <skram> permanently
19:56:10 <skram> I got a spare room with a firetruck bed in it if you like
19:57:56 <Camail> beep beep
19:58:09 <Dot`> sounds dangerous reif
19:59:06 <Camail> new CR is tomorrow
19:59:14 <Camail> also dot, how'd you like the start of this arc
19:59:22 <Camail> pretty juicy
20:00:57 <Dot`> things are indeed happening
20:02:40 <Camail> i will say, i didnt expect them to fuck up this quickly
20:03:44 <Camail> i think they are underestimating how important that person is
20:03:53 <Camail> well, everyone but liam
20:06:42 <Dot`> haha yea, they are very use to doing their own thing
20:29:27 <Camail> good news: kanye dropped out of the race

22:25:07 <Runbunny> Hallo Friends.
22:26:32 <Dot`> runbun
22:26:38 <reification> hi bun
22:26:41 <skram> Runbun. Hello.
22:27:58 <Rawr|Fone> Anders.
22:28:37 <Runbunny> No more work (hopefully) for like 9 hours.
22:29:46 <Rawr|Fone> What are you going to do with all this free time runbun
22:30:33 <Dot`> i bet its vtubers
22:35:39 <Runbunny> Hmm.
22:36:11 <Runbunny> That reminds me.
22:36:47 <skram> what does it remind you off andersen
22:37:45 <Runbunny> The chinese antis or Nationalist is more prober term.
22:37:46 <Runbunny> reification, https://ibb.co/s9wDcSk
22:40:44 <reification> .mtg wall of runes
22:41:34 <reification> bun https://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=461002
22:41:45 <reification> what is tl;dr?
22:43:42 <reification> melody got twitch ban?
22:44:38 <skram> ye
22:45:18 <Runbunny> No no this is about the nationalist chinese, the one china policy and hololiveCN.
22:45:27 <Runbunny> But Melody was also banned.
22:45:33 <Runbunny> A sad day indeed.
22:45:38 <reification> ah those were separate comments
22:45:57 <Dot`> runbun https://imgur.com/gallery/Nr0tBCB
22:46:17 <reification> yes CN is super nationalist about one china policy to a very uniform extent
22:46:45 <Runbunny> Good dog.
22:47:04 <reification> iirc it isn’t that long ago that taiwan gave up it’s claims on… mongolia
22:47:35 <Runbunny> Well, artia is pretty two faced about the whole thing.
22:52:46 <reification> it’s an issue (like israel in the middle east) where ppl are often surprised to find out how extreme the view of what they had considered moderate friends are
22:52:57 <reification> so i can be sad but not surprised
22:53:47 <reification> pretty sure denying any chinese teritorial claim is a serious crime there
22:56:31 <reification> in fact if i remember nightwatch correctly it’s treated as treason meaning liable for death penalty
23:04:11 <Runbunny> Hmm.
23:04:33 <Runbunny> I guess I am never going to China then :/
23:06:04 <reification> ah, you wouldn’t have to worry but if you are chinese and of any note…
23:08:32 <Runbunny> Well Henrik thinks of me, surely that means a lot.
23:10:06 <Rawr|Fone> Yes Anders
23:14:40 <Camail> i would love to care about global politics 
23:14:59 <Camail> this god damned election needs to be done
23:19:16 <reification> doesn’t look hopeful :/
23:29:39 <reification> night all
23:32:13 <Camail> it actually looks hopeful
23:32:17 <Camail> but its just stressful
23:32:28 <Camail> biden ahead
23:33:01 <Camail> that map might look pretty red if you dont realize how much of it is empty space
23:35:21 <Golly> reeeeeepublicaaaaaaans in spaaaaaaaaaceeeee
23:35:51 <reification> ah i meant the process being fast, transparent and result accepted by both side. biden was 80% on betting markets last i saw
23:38:47 <Camail> once the results are in, it is VERY unlikely that they change
23:38:50 <Camail> for good or bad
23:39:54 <Camail> we're just waiting on nevada
23:41:59 <reification> i shall actually sleep now
