15:02:45 <DuB`> Waow, wild F1 race
15:03:06 <DuB`> First time in 8 years there's no Merc/RB/Ferrari on the podium
15:09:50 <Cane> Well, hot damn, Renault's F1 team is rebranding as Alpine next year.
15:10:46 <Cane> It's been a while.
15:16:44 <DuB`> Kewl
15:17:51 <Cane> The Alpine A110 was such a cool classic rally car.
15:18:36 <Cane> https://s31.wheelsage.org/format/picture/picture-preview-large/a/alpine/renault_a110_rally_car/renault_alpine_a110_rally_car.jpg
15:18:52 <Cane> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Renault_Alpine_A_110_%28Sp%29.JPG
15:18:54 <DuB`> So round and cute!
15:19:03 <DuB`> Pretty
15:19:22 <Cane> Uh huh! It's my favourite rally car ever, and one of my favourite cars.
15:19:36 <Cane> It won the very first WRC.
15:19:41 <Cane> 1973 that was.
15:20:43 <Cane> The Alpine A110 was just a cute little french sports coupé, and somehow it was one of the best rally cars of all time. It weighted actually nothing.
15:20:46 <Cane> weighed*
15:21:35 <Cane> It won so many races in the 60s and early 70s by being so light and nimble. It was like 600kg, ridiculous stuff.
15:21:43 <Cane> Know why it didn't win in 1974?
15:21:59 <Cane> Because the biggest name in rally motorsports, Lancia, released the Lancia Stratos that year.
15:22:12 <DuB`> Ah
15:22:22 <DuB`> Oh THAT lancia :P
15:23:37 <Cane> Yep. The Stratos was the very first purpose-built vehicle designed from the ground up to BE a rally car.
15:23:58 <Cane> So look at it this way: The Alpine was so good, it took a purpose-built custom job from the massive italian motorsport manufacturer Lancia to beat a french sports coupé! That's a pretty good legacy.
15:25:22 <Cane> Then Alpine went away until the name was resurrected in 2017, when they releaed the new A110.
15:25:45 <Cane> They've been doing some GT races, so Alpine ahs kind of become Renault's "racing" brand.
15:25:51 <Cane> So it sort of makes sense that the F1 team is rebranding.
15:29:46 <DuB`> I see I see, seems cool
15:30:02 <DuB`> Sad morning... Nigma lost and is out of tourney, and Verstappen DNF >:(
15:36:39 <Cane> At least Nigma gave us good Arc Warden games this tournament.
15:37:49 <DuB`> Yesterday's games were nutso, that was a blast to watch
15:37:53 <Cane> Seriously.
15:38:00 <Cane> One of the best days of Dota I've seen in a long time.

20:52:42 <Dot`> pon
21:02:15 <Camail> nop
21:02:33 <Camail> so i'm poking around in horizon zero dawn, its fun
21:02:56 <Camail> the face rigging is a bit...off sometimes, but its been way more fun than most AAA games
21:03:34 <Camail> the port isnt bad if you aren't trying to stroke off to your pc specs
21:13:27 <Runbunny> Horizon zero dawn just disappeared when it came out on console. Everyone was playing it -> gone, never heard about it again until pc port.
21:15:26 <Camail> its a narrative game, there's not much to say after everyone's played it
21:16:47 <Camail> so far, its like if far cry didnt sell its soul
21:19:04 <Golly> even so, i think ill wait to see if they optimize it better
22:06:39 <BioSC> almost 60 kills
22:06:42 <BioSC> noice
