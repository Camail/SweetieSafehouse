15:24:16 <Camail> it turned into a tlp classic
15:24:25 <Rawr|Fone> ?
15:24:38 <Camail> in table top simulator
15:24:44 <Camail> its kinda complicated and stupid at the same time
15:25:26 <Rawr|Fone> Oh
15:25:26 <Rawr|Fone> Nerd thing
15:25:26 <Camail> its  bottle of ranch that someone editted to say runch instead

15:26:17 <Rawr|Fone> Hmm
15:27:53 <Camail> it was a fun tts session, i didnt realize reif just installed the game when i shoved him in the middle of the game we were playing >_>

17:31:58 <Camail> broadly, database stuff. I'm heading up an effort to modernize/digitize a steel fabrication company's data so they can get certification
17:34:09 <Camail> but I'm kinda doing everything? I have to design the forms they're gonna be using for data entry so i have data to work with
17:34:36 <Camail> i dont really want to make a database because i'm just one guy, doing all of it in VBA and excel at the moment cuz that's what they have
17:34:52 <Rawr|Fone> Like freelancing?
17:34:58 <Rawr|Fone> Sounds tough
17:35:40 <Camail> eh, i'm fine
17:36:06 <Camail> its super chill, its just gonna take a long time to do it all
17:36:43 <Camail> and it'll probably turn into a stable position
17:36:47 <Rawr|Fone> That's good
17:36:54 <DuB`> :O
17:36:59 <DuB`> Ooh nice, sounds p cool
17:39:06 <Camail> the only thing keeping me from freaking out at the scope of it all is how hopeless they are
17:39:23 <Camail> like, somebody needs to help these people, and it kinda has to be me
17:40:01 <Rawr|Fone> I feel the same about my company
17:40:16 <Camail> hahaha, its a nice feeling tho
17:40:19 <Camail> its better than fear
17:41:42 <Camail> also when i'm done i'll have a project to be legitimately proud of, which is nice
17:42:08 <Camail> i'm sooooo shit at motivating myself to do open source projects

18:51:47 <Camail> i really hope they add that

19:25:05 <reification> maybe it is plotting to take over skram
19:26:06 <reification> got me a comp deathmatch win. good ol' mercy 1st, zen 2nd game :D
19:31:31 <skrm> cat is not human, dot
19:32:26 <Dot|Phone> Only humans have the right to stand? 
19:32:35 <skrm> yes
19:59:35 <Rawr|Phone> What about horses skrm
19:59:56 <skrm> absolutely not
20:06:11 <Rawr|Phone> Hmm
20:17:48 <Camail> skrm if you're still interested in bannerlord we could do a multiplayer game
20:17:51 <Camail> 100% understand if you dont tho
20:18:45 <skrm> that could be fun, actually
20:18:54 <skrm> ill think about it when i get home
20:20:18 <Camail> multiplayer doesnt have the main quest at all, which doesnt change anything, tbh
20:23:50 <Camail> is anyone else interested?
20:25:18 <Runbunny> As in multiplayer campaign?
20:25:32 <Camail> oh, youve done it before
20:25:34 <Camail> how does it work
20:25:36 <Camail> is there still ai
20:25:47 <Runbunny> Nope.
20:25:51 <Camail> oh
20:25:52 <Camail> thats shit
20:25:54 <Camail> nvm then
20:25:55 <Runbunny> It's just players.
20:26:04 <Camail> skrm scratch that
20:26:10 <Runbunny> But the servers are kinda wonky and queues are long.
20:26:24 <Camail> if they release proper multiplayer later on then maybe
20:26:37 <Camail> cant you host your own server?
20:26:45 <Runbunny> Not currently I think
20:27:28 <Runbunny> The server list is like 10 servers, but those only TDM servers.
20:28:29 <Runbunny> But you can only queue for skirmish, captain and siege (I think it was called)
20:28:44 <Camail> ah
20:28:46 <Camail> yea that's lame
20:29:55 <Camail> welp, we'll see where it is in a year

23:42:43 <Camail> skrma i dunno if you saw but bannerlord doesnt support real multiplayer so thats a big no
23:43:08 <Camail> i could like, help you through the game if you still wanted to play, but theres a 0% chance we could play together for quite a long time
23:43:19 <Camail> so i'd suggest just forgetting about it
23:44:13 <Camail> i assume TI is gonna be online this year?
23:44:22 <Camail> does that actually change much for dota?
23:44:24 <skram> no news yet afaik
23:44:40 <skram> gameplay-wise, probably not
23:44:49 <Camail> planning anything for this year is a fairly large risk
23:45:07 <skram> fun part of TI is all the stupid shit around it
23:45:16 <Camail> but the pandemic will probably end before autumn
23:45:19 <skram> kinda like thew half time thing at the superbowl maybe?

23:46:31 <skram> most of the restrictions will probably end before autumn, not sure if the pandemic is gonna be over though
23:47:09 <skram> crete has officially banned sweden though
