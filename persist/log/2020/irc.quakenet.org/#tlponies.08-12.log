19:58:23 <reification> hi bun https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJ1ldLuWJtg
20:04:36 <Runbunny> Noooooooooo
20:04:47 <Runbunny> That video is blocked in my country as well.
20:05:15 <reification> what a lousy country :p
20:05:28 <Runbunny> I don't get it.
20:05:35 <reification> vpn time
20:06:16 <Runbunny> There's another cover by a seiyu and that video is fine.
20:06:36 <Runbunny> I am upset.
20:06:43 <skram> get your fucking act together, denmark
20:06:47 <skram> smh my head
20:07:26 <Runbunny> This whole thing actually started because youtube wanted to pay 70% less.
20:07:32 <Runbunny> in royalties.
20:08:41 <skram> hmm
20:08:46 <skram> fuck youtube then
20:08:53 <skram> lets make our own video sharing site
20:09:00 <skram> with blackjack and hookers
20:09:03 <Runbunny> Hmm.
20:09:22 <Runbunny> That just sound like a camgirl site with more steps.
20:10:25 <skram> i dont think camgirls play blackjack??
20:10:35 <skram> ill have to do some research
20:12:12 <Runbunny> If you throw some money their way they'll probably play blackjack.
