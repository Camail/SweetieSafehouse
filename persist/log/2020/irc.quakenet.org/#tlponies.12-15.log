01:52:09 <Camail> huh, i inadvertantly found every fast travel location
01:52:48 <Camail> i have no idea how anyone manages to get to lvl 20 in any skill before beating the game
01:52:55 <Camail> i think my highest was 12
01:53:08 <Camail> you gotta be playing for obscene amounts of time 
01:55:48 <skram> how much side stuff did you do?
02:01:26 <Camail> i have 60 hours on the save
02:04:05 <Camail> i did every sidejob other than the big "do thing 20 times" ones

15:20:59 <Dot`> hmm
15:29:19 <Rawr|Fone> Indeed
15:35:21 <Cane> I just want to reiterate that I named my 2D lighting engine "RogueLight" and it still makes me smile.
15:40:42 <Dot`> i read that as lightning engine the first time. it makes more sense now. though it works for both

18:11:11 <skram> how was the ending
18:11:26 <Camail> appropriate
18:12:13 <Camail> i got almost all of what i wanted, but not the one thing that would make it matter
18:12:23 <skram> aww
18:12:26 <Dot`> F
18:12:48 <skram> I cant tell which decisions matter in this game
18:13:00 <skram> like in witcher and all bioware games it seems really obvious
18:17:44 <Camail> choices only matter as much as they matter to you, in anything
18:26:58 <reification> sounds existentialist 
18:49:36 <Golly> heed the voice of Camalious, you must seek the answers within yourself
18:59:00 <skram> myself? i dont trust that fuckin guy

20:09:23 <DuB`> I do need to go get groceries before the blizzard and NYC re-shutdown though...
20:09:48 <Dot|Phone> Take your 10 for pole dub
20:09:53 <BioSC> don't starve irl
20:10:16 <Dot|Phone> Good for fending off ppl and checking snow drifts
20:13:25 <DuB`> Hopefully no power outages
20:51:36 <Dot`> i wonder if dub has died of starvation yet
20:52:03 <BioSC> probably
20:52:08 <BioSC> rip
20:52:24 <skram> He's out makin snow angels
20:52:39 <skram> y'all leave him alone
20:52:58 <Dot`> he is just so fragile skram, we worry
20:53:07 <Camail> he's been dead for 4 years
20:54:42 <skram> is that why im hearing the x-files theme song right now
21:14:57 <Camail> yes
21:39:28 <DuB`> wha
21:40:18 <DuB`> Legends never die
21:40:28 <DuB`> Unless you're in cyberpunk, then you can't be a legend UNLESS you die
21:46:28 <skram> gee i sure hope they name a cocktail after me
21:59:15 <DuB`> A cocktail named after the main character in cyberpunk... the "V-Sauce"?
