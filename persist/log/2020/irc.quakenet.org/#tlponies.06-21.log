04:46:46 <Micen_> Thats spooky Cane.
04:47:18 <Cane> <3
04:50:06 <Micen> Maybe I should be bad at Terraria for a bit. I played a total of 3 hours according to steam, and i think 2.5 of that was card farming one year. 
04:50:47 <Cane> Have you played anything like it that you enjoyed?
04:51:22 <Cane> It's in my top 10 games of all time list, and I've clocked a ridiculous amount of hours in it.
04:53:55 <Micen> I played a bit once, but i kind of felt like i was cheating since a friend loaded me out with end game items.  Some big sowrd thing that reminded me of the big sword in SOTN and flight. 
04:55:20 <Micen> and after that going back to having nothing didnt feel too great. but my backlog is so huge 
04:56:45 <Micen> I also have issues with any games with building in them. years of mmo has ruined me for just having fun. Always got to go after that next carrot. or upgrade. 
05:03:50 <Micen> And what do you consider like Terraria? I dont really have enough experience to say what is and isnt like it. 
05:13:57 <Cane> Yeah, the whole point of a Metroidvania is the progression. Getting endgame gear right away means you saw none of the game.
05:14:20 <Cane> Terraria is not exactly 2D Minecraft, but it's a good starting point for an explanation.
05:14:28 <Cane> Minecraft is almost entirely building, with some digging for materials.
05:14:51 <Cane> Terraria is that, but in 2D, and with Metroidvania progression and tons and tons of weapons and equipment and armour and spells and loot and tons of bosses and challenging events.
05:15:10 <Micen> hmm, I should give it another go. 
05:15:18 <Cane> Building homes is optional, although at least making some boxes so your NPC friends can move in is useful since they all do useful things.
05:15:29 <Cane> Several people in this channel have played it. Maybe ask them for a co-op playthrough.
05:15:35 <Cane> It's usually more fun with friends.
05:15:44 <Micen> thats an option.

15:16:17 <Micen> Hello
15:16:27 <skram> heya micen
15:19:38 <Micen> Skram, ive watched an episode of Girls Und Panzer finally
15:19:52 <skram> Its really good, right?
15:19:57 <Micen> the main characters best friends kind of suck. 
15:20:03 <skram> :O
15:20:14 <skram> no way
15:20:55 <skram> actually yes, but not in episode 2->
15:21:43 <Micen> MC: "I dont want to do this one particular thing thats is in our culture." and friends say okay,  then immedately after in the last half of the episode they are talking about how awesome sensha do is, and life will be ruined if they all dont do it. 
15:22:28 <Micen> but then again, i might be over analyzing a single episode of an anime. 
15:22:59 <skram> dont think too hard about it lol
15:23:19 <skram> its a funny sol cartoon about tanks and not a commentary on friend dynamics, just do the rest
15:23:33 <Micen> im also still up from before dnd yesterday. 
15:23:57 <skram> you should go to bed micen thats like 10 hours ago D:
15:24:18 <Micen> but Halvs dnd is in like a half hour. 
15:25:07 <skram> well dang
15:25:37 <Micen> i shall chug all the caffeinated beverages. 
15:25:47 <skram> if you do 100, time stops
15:26:59 <Micen> maybe. 
15:27:17 <Micen> or maybe it will be like this meme bio linked

19:55:11 <Runbunny> It's just shitposting, I guess.
19:56:27 <Runbunny> Seems (to me) like Haato has been messing about with degenerates and tries to play off them.
19:56:29 <Runbunny> Kinda.
19:56:34 <Runbunny> I am not sure how to explain it.
19:56:58 <skram> I get it
19:57:14 <skram> Not very idol-like tho
