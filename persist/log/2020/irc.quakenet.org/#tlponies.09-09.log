13:18:08 <Dot`> i woke up today thinking it was friday
13:18:10 <Dot`> been a long week
13:19:26 <Rawr|Fone> There he is
13:19:31 <Rawr|Fone> The Jonas
13:20:22 <Runbunny> I had a "monday" today.
13:20:28 <Runbunny> Tons of problems.
13:20:40 <skram> Henriken gamle ørn
13:21:14 <Runbunny> Grabbar.
13:21:18 <skram> Did you accidentally create gold again in your alchemy lab, Anders?
13:23:54 <Runbunny> No, a pc keyboard wasn't working, so I went to the depot and got another keyboard (from the military), turns out the pc just needed to be rebooted.
13:23:59 <Dot`> probably created the purest green skram
13:37:39 <Dot`> hows the lazy week going skram?

13:46:36 <skram> Its been alright, head hurts today though
13:47:09 <skram> I had TWO alcoholic drinks yesterday y'see
13:47:42 <Dot`> well, if they where barrel sized drinks that might be the casue
13:47:46 <Dot`> cause*
13:48:03 <skram> naw, just standard single servings
13:48:23 <skram> 2oz spirit pours
13:49:25 <Dot`> i have no idea the size of that, im guessing now that its a thimble
13:50:05 <skram> one ounce is 30 ml
13:50:08 <skram> or one liquid ounce
13:50:19 <skram> because theres is a not-liquid ounce thats different??
13:50:33 <skram> very confusing
13:51:33 <Dot`> makes perfect sense
13:52:34 <skram> not at all
13:55:56 <Runbunny> Skram, are you sure you're a dwarf?
13:56:10 <skram> i am not, anders
13:56:13 <Runbunny> Aren't they known for their constitution?
13:59:59 <Rawr|Fone> Skram is a horse
14:00:07 <skram> skram is a real boy
