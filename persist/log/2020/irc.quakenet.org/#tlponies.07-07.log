15:47:59 <carcinisation> i just found i had won a £50 i hadn't realised at the weekend :D
15:48:26 <carcinisation> that's a good start
15:49:34 <Dot`> free money is great
15:52:43 <skrm> thats like 5 gacha spins
15:52:45 <skrm> or something
15:54:45 <DvB`> 25 pulls in arknights :P
15:57:04 <carcinisation> those are also free if you find old google play gift cards :D
15:57:33 <skrm> its not entirely free if you bought those cards yourself reifen
15:57:39 <skrm> even if it was 100 years ago
15:57:49 <carcinisation> but you should be getting a lot more for your monies than that dub
15:59:08 <carcinisation> monthly card is a 10pull for $5 from the originum alone
16:00:49 <DvB`> I just wanted a quick quip so looked at the $50 originium pack -> orundum lol :P
16:05:30 <carcinisation> i'll let you off cause i said originum when i meant orundum
