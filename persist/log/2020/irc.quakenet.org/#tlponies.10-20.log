10:13:43 <Runbunny> Hai.
10:14:09 <Runbunny> I went to work for an 1 hour meeting and then went home in preparation of going to work later.
10:20:41 <Dot`> Hi bun, golly
10:28:07 <Runbunny> Dot Dot.
10:41:08 <reification> your work appears somewhat disorganised bun
10:45:07 <Runbunny> Not it is. I am just putting extra work.
10:45:18 <Runbunny> I also thought the meeting was more important than it was.
