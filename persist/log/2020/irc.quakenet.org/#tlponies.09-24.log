11:08:27 <Runbunny> Look at me doing stuff I promised myself I'd do.
11:08:32 <skram> good job buddy

11:10:39 <Runbunny> I just have 8½ hours of work today and then I have tomorrow off.
11:10:45 <Runbunny> Then it's back to work.
11:17:05 <skram> a whole day off!
11:17:46 <Dot`> imagine skram, having a whole day off
11:17:52 <skram> what a luxury
11:21:27 <Runbunny> I am looking forward to it.
11:21:52 <Runbunny> I'll savour every second and wear new shoes at the same time.
11:21:57 <Runbunny> You guys can't stop me.
11:22:05 <skram> I dont even want to
11:22:29 <Runbunny> Yay!
11:23:16 <Dot`> new shoes? did you get the light up ones skram talked about?
11:26:37 <Runbunny> Sadly they didn't have those.
11:28:25 <Runbunny> However, the possibility of mounting my bike lights to my shoes exist.

22:54:29 <Runbunny> Camail, Second wind work on void sphere! I was thinking it only worked with travel skills.
22:54:50 <Camail> nope, works on everything, and gives charges to non-instant spells
22:55:03 <Camail> it actually had second wind on for the skill demo
22:55:26 <Runbunny> I didn't watch the void sphere one :D

22:55:49 <Camail> the cooldown is rough, i think the lowest you can make it is ~4 seconds
22:56:22 <Runbunny> I don't use it as a main skill so that's no problem.
22:56:57 <Camail> yea its neat, the positional skills they added are pretty cool
22:57:29 <Camail> i think fire wall, the mana one, and the ice bubble one are pretty interesting
22:58:11 <Runbunny> Yeah, there are so many skills I want to put in my build now.
23:01:31 <reification> night all
23:02:02 <Dot|Phone> Gnight Reif
23:03:06 <Runbunny> Goodnight Reif.
23:41:38 <Camail> Runbunny  have you done an archmage build yet?
23:41:42 <Camail> they're very fun
23:42:01 <Camail> probably my favorite kind of build
23:47:45 <Runbunny> Nope. I'm making a elementalist crackling lance build. However I have been picking up a bunch of the mana nodes and they're really nice.
23:47:52 <Runbunny> For Mind over Matter.
