00:00:41 <Micen> Sorry its a nuthouse here. and that last sentence made no sense. been feeling bad, so i left it unhooked for longer than i intended when i pulled it. 
00:01:52 <Dot|Phone> How's the family thing going Micen
00:03:19 <Micen> family is going okay. was supposed to grill but spent all day cleaning grill, and kitchen. our fridge died a couple weeks ago and the new one was supposed to be delivered today. 
00:04:03 <Micen> however that didnt happen. its not even in state. so we went with a different one that is in the store and they are rush delivering it tomorrow for free since their webstore screwed up. 
00:05:01 <skrma> did y'all get one of those big fancy ones with ice cube dispenser and twitter on it?
00:06:47 <Dot|Phone> Didn't your oven die like 3 months ago? 
00:06:50 <Micen> no. we have hard water that we dont dare actually drink. 
00:06:58 <Dot|Phone> Kitchen having a rough time
00:07:00 <Micen> our oven died in december. 
00:07:03 <Micen> it truly is. 
00:07:42 <Micen> well the oven was from the summer of 1965 as best as I can date it, its not well documented. and the fridge was 26 years. 
00:08:13 <skrma> well, I think they paid their debt at that point
00:08:17 <skrma> gas or electric?
00:08:29 <Micen> electric. 
00:08:50 <Dot|Phone> Gas is scary
00:09:12 <skrma> I really want a gas range but gas doesnt exist as a utility up here
00:09:33 <Micen> I want gas too, but we would have to reno the bottom two floors of the house for hookups. 
00:10:09 <skrma> thats a lotta work
00:10:09 <Dot|Phone> Micen you need to move to a place with less stairs
00:10:27 <Micen> well i say bottom two floors i mean basement and ground floor. 
00:11:07 <Micen> and we really do, the stairs are like 15 degrees steeper than  what is currently recommended by building code
00:13:00 <Dot|Phone> My old apartment had the death trap of stairs. I'm still surprised I made it out alive
00:13:32 <Dot|Phone> Not only really steep to almost be a ladder. Each step was like a half step alternating left and right
00:14:24 <Dot|Phone> And varnished  wood so slippery 
00:15:08 <skrma> Before I moved in, this house had like an elevator on rails going up the stairs
00:15:16 <skrma> maybe get one of those dot
00:15:31 <Dot|Phone> Haha. I'm getting to that age skram
00:15:52 <skrma> also, found out that the winter garden thing has a leaky roof
00:16:06 <skrma> so now i get to rip the roofing up and see what the damage is
00:16:23 <Dot|Phone> Owning a horse is expensive
00:16:27 <Dot|Phone> A house to
00:17:23 <skrma> having an apartment was easier
00:18:04 <Dot|Phone> But this house is yours. And when you do work on it is yours
00:18:10 <Dot|Phone> That must be nice
00:18:46 <skrma> its too much power
00:18:56 <Micen> its also a money sink. 
00:18:59 <skrma> aint nobody stopping me from cutting a hole in it with a chainsaw and thats a bit dangerous
00:19:00 <Micen> somethings always broken. 
00:21:00 <skrma> well
00:21:22 <skrma> it doesnt need to be broken to need fixin, you know?
00:21:36 <skrma> like my old worn out kitchen isnt broken but i really wanna fix it anyway
00:24:07 <Micen> my sister brought a new riding lawn mower to take care of the lawn. 5 minutes out the magneto inside died.. 
00:24:13 <Micen> that also happened today. 
00:25:07 <skrma> hopefully its covered by a warranty of some sort?
00:25:11 <Micen> it is. 
00:26:40 <Micen> but it was from one of those financing websites, so they have to come out, crate it up, take it back, repair it, then bring it back. 
00:26:49 <skrma> i should go to bed tho
00:26:50 <skrma> aww
00:26:55 <skrma> thats gonna take 4ever
00:27:01 <skrma> gnight
00:27:38 <Micen> good night skram. sleep well 
00:28:00 <Micen> i will eat a bratwurst in your name. 
00:28:41 <Dot|Phone> Gnight 
00:28:43 <Dot|Phone> I go too
