10:34:32 <Runbunny> Hai.
10:37:46 <Runbunny> Glad they included that table.
10:51:41 <reification> it certainly illuminates the development of language's emphasis on justifying existing beliefs vs divining true ones

15:00:41 <reification> golly are you sure. i know it is usually misrepresented but i thought the real story was as per: https://www.smh.com.au/national/this-is-democracy-manifest-mystery-star-of-viral-video-found-at-last-20200307-p547vr.html
15:02:29 <reification> see also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Manifest
15:03:18 <Golly> hm i havent seen that interview before
15:05:33 <reification> it was usually claimed before to be "Paul Charles Dozsa, a Hungarian chess player and notorious dine and dasher" which didn't add up on various counts, which would presumably be why people may have called it staged.
15:06:11 <Golly> i think the camerawork also seemed a bit to professional or something
