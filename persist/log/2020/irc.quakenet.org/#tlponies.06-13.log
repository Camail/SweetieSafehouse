00:14:47 <skram> theres cool stuff on the internet
00:15:13 <Zounds> direct me skram lad
00:16:23 <Zounds> I have cookie crumble galaxy chocolate and its rather tasty
00:16:51 <skram> look at this thing going zounds https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I6I2JOJhHY
00:18:03 <skram> some pals of mine suddenly showed up with beer and flowers earlier
00:18:15 <Zounds> this may soothe the soul skram lad
00:18:24 <skram> like grats on the house heres some carlsberg and some random flowers i found on the side of the road
00:20:41 <Zounds> yeh man, gz
00:20:51 <Zounds> never really said it at the time but it's a big deal
00:21:04 <Zounds> paying a mortgage myself
00:21:16 <skram> heck yeah
00:21:57 <Zounds> making our way through this life
00:22:48 <skram> my mortgage is as much as my rent previously so its a good deal
00:23:14 <Zounds> mmm indeed
00:23:53 <Zounds> As much as mortgages can suck it feels good building towards ownership
00:24:49 <Zounds> Got a place like 10 min walk away from my workplace
00:25:28 <skram> hows your work been affected by the whole covid thing by the way?
00:25:57 <skram> since theres not a lot of big arrangements happening these days i guess
00:26:12 <Zounds> there was a bit of upheaval getting everyone ready but things have settled
00:26:36 <Zounds> events shifts have gone almost completely but so much void property security to do it more than makes up for it
00:26:58 <skram> thats good
00:27:01 <Zounds> Yeh
00:28:28 <Zounds> Was easy for us to be seen as essential and continue our business
