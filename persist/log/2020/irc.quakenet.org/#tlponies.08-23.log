08:42:57 <Runbunny> Dot!
08:43:23 <Runbunny> It would seem that Minato Aqua had a nice concert a few days ago. 
08:43:28 <Runbunny> Pretty neat.
08:45:12 <Dot`> sounds great
08:46:07 <Runbunny> Warms my heart.
09:07:25 <Rawr|Fone> Anders.
09:10:26 <Runbunny> Henrik.
09:11:37 <Rawr|Fone> I'm glad to see you today
09:13:11 <Runbunny> I would sleep if I could.
09:13:51 <Rawr|Fone> But then you wouldn't be here with us
09:14:02 <Runbunny> It's rough today.
09:15:08 <Rawr|Fone> What's on your mind dear
09:17:12 <Runbunny> It's not that something is on my mind, it's more the accidental poisoning of myself yesterday.
09:18:04 <Rawr|Fone> That is something you would want to avoid
09:18:10 <Runbunny> Yes
09:24:07 <Dot`> did you eat too much cake bun?
09:32:18 <Runbunny> I'd wish that was the case.

14:23:29 <BioSC> its truly the end times
14:26:47 <skram> crumpets are overrated

14:34:51 <Dot`> why you all like this
14:35:18 <Dot`> and yea there are things better than crumpets, there are also things better than bacon
14:35:22 <Dot`> like crispy bacon
14:35:37 <BioSC> *slowly lowers gun*
14:36:02 <BioSC> *shoots off freedom fireworks*
14:36:30 <skram> bacon is kinda overrated too
14:36:45 <BioSC> *snaps gun back up*
14:36:51 <BioSC> skorm pls
14:36:53 <BioSC> don't make me do dis
14:37:15 <BioSC> bacon IS breakfast
14:37:28 <BioSC> don't @ me
14:37:32 <BioSC> can't change my mind
14:37:33 <BioSC> ect
14:38:05 <skram> hey i really like bacon too
14:38:13 <skram> but some people treat it like its ambrosia or whatever
14:38:19 <BioSC> it is tho?
14:38:53 <skram> remember back when we had bacon flavored sodas and bacon smelling candles
14:38:59 <skram> and bacon everything?
14:39:03 <skram> its not THAT great
14:39:16 <BioSC> this isn't real bacon, its bacon chemicals
14:39:20 <BioSC> only true bacon
14:42:04 <reification> what if we had bacon on crumpets?
14:42:25 <Dot`> my immediate reaction was to reject, but now.... i wonder
14:42:35 <Dot`> put a fried egg on too

20:20:45 <Dot`> this run, or all 12 by the deadline?
20:21:12 <Runbunny> The deadline.

20:25:12 <Runbunny> Hopefully he'll pick up speed somehow.
20:26:13 <Dot`> Sych hope
20:27:28 <Runbunny> Well he did do the one thing you should never do.
20:27:37 <Runbunny> Let something be decided by the internet.
20:27:57 <Dot`> hubris!
20:29:51 <Runbunny> Especially if it is a permanent thing on your body...
21:01:57 <Camail> aaannnd mikez is killing his studio

21:02:11 <Camail> social suicide wasnt enough for him
