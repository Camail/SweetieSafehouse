17:53:22 <Rawr|Fone> Ai
17:57:00 <BioPhone> Hi
18:00:35 <Camail> hello
18:14:18 <Camail> the more i see  of valorant the farther away it is from cs
18:14:32 <Camail> aiming is incredibly easy
18:15:32 <Camail> and abilities are so powerful...its almost boring
18:15:42 <Camail> but its neat that theres another popular fps
18:16:02 <Camail> everyone is on the same page that the game is significantly easier than cs
18:17:34 <Runbunny> Neat.
18:22:15 <Golly> easier aiming, are the hitboxes more lenient or something?
18:25:10 <Runbunny> Less recoil on weapons I think.
18:25:32 <Runbunny> Enlighten us Camail.
18:26:34 <Camail> movespeed is much lower, aim punch is higher so if you get the first bullet int he duel you basically win, and tagging is WAAAY higher so after you land a bullet their velocity goes to near 0
18:26:55 <Camail> all of that combined, not to mention wall bangs on corners
18:27:08 <Golly> mkay
18:27:57 <Camail> the biggest thing is opponent speed, way easier to land the first shot because they just move so slowly
18:28:29 <Camail> oh also no counter strafing, its easier to stop moving and start shooting

19:49:55 <Runbunny> I am not tenderizing as much as I should :/
19:50:12 <skram> ill tenderize u bby ;)
19:51:15 <Runbunny> Well dual blades have the combo you can cheat into a claw attack that tenderizes. So those don't really have the trouble.
19:51:51 <DuB`> Ya ya

20:17:39 <Runbunny> Dot`, Are the happy hob songs on spotify?
20:17:54 <Dot`> i dont know bun
20:18:09 <skram> hob has happy songs?
20:18:57 <Runbunny> Yeah, there's a nice one about rats.
20:20:05 <Runbunny> Oh it's on soundcloud.
20:20:41 <Runbunny> skram, https://soundcloud.com/replicantwave/replicant-my-fucking-dick-smells-like-cheese-feat-the-habby-hob/s-MeT21
20:24:41 <skram> is he ok?
20:25:28 <Runbunny> https://soundcloud.com/replicantwave/i-hope-you-burn-feat-the-happy-hob/s-EfOqgrTUTOe?in=replicantwave/sets/dumb-shit//s-sl02Q
20:26:51 <Runbunny> I am certain that Hob lost his mind a long time ago. Sadly somewhere along the line his ego swelled and now he is stuck in a bet that he has very low chance of winning.
20:27:10 <Dot`> skram, he hasnt been since mid god run 1
20:30:41 <skram> how long has it been since then
20:30:44 <skram> 20 years?
20:31:06 <Runbunny> Like a year? and a few months?
20:31:51 <skram> oh
20:32:04 <skram> hasnt he been doing ds runs since forever?
20:34:03 <Runbunny> But the god run was special.
20:34:32 <Dot`> was, now there are 2 of them
20:34:57 <Runbunny> Camail, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T25_s0vK3FA
20:37:28 <Camail> i expect many dicks from you now, runbun
20:39:14 <Camail> is hob stuck in a place where his channel is built on challenge runs and has to constantly 1up himself?
20:39:31 <Camail> thats why the speedrunning streamers all left
20:39:54 <Camail> after like 3-4 years they were just tired of speedrunning the same category
20:40:39 <Dot`> speedrunning does seem like the perfect way to get bored of your favourite game
20:40:54 <Runbunny> Kind of. I do think he like the no hit runs, but he's sick of playing the same games over and over again.
20:41:37 <Runbunny> I think even more now that god run require him to play all the souls games in a row without getting hit.
