15:30:44 <Dot`> marmite
15:35:16 <reification> no dot. one is a disgusting goop masquerading as food, the other is an anime about catholic schoolgirls >.>
15:36:11 <Dot`> what about vegimite?
15:37:57 <reification> that's just upside down marmite
15:40:29 <Dot`> does that make it good?
15:40:47 <reification> just more likely to be poisonous :p

21:11:10 <BioSC> no corpses, no ai scavs
21:11:14 <BioSC> just me
21:11:16 <BioSC> and no loot
21:12:56 <Dot`> did you accedentaly go offline?
21:12:57 <Dot`> lol
21:13:08 <BioSC> nope, it was a real raid
21:13:17 <BioSC> i got my scav's level 4 armor out of it

21:31:20 <Dot|Phone> Eat ice cream 
21:32:06 <Runbunny> Don't have any, best I can do is ice cubes.
21:33:12 <Dot|Phone> Well it's a dire situation indeed
21:35:00 <skram> put them in your pants, Anders
21:36:14 <Dot|Phone> Skram when do you find out of you are getting more holiday? 
21:36:50 <skram> tuesday probably
21:37:16 <Dot|Phone> I thought test times where down to like 90 minutes
21:37:36 <Dot|Phone> Hmm
21:39:59 <skram> yeah me too
21:44:49 <Runbunny> Jonas, I took my pants off.
21:46:08 <Dot|Phone> The real question is. Why where they on
21:49:54 <Runbunny> To avoid public indecency. 
21:50:23 <Dot|Phone> As long as you wear a mask
21:52:00 <Runbunny> Did not :D
21:52:31 <Dot|Phone> That's nothing to be proud of bun
21:52:43 <Dot|Phone> Don't kill grandmothers
21:54:27 <Runbunny> In all the 30 minutes I was outside and in the store I passed like 3 people inside the store. Other than that I was more than 2 meters away from anyone.
21:55:07 <Dot|Phone> And no one complained you didn't have pants on? 
21:55:45 <Runbunny> No no, I had pants on, because I went outside. Now they're off.
21:56:07 <skram> good plan
