19:49:21 <Camail> maybe he's right
19:49:24 <Camail> maybe its hopeless

19:50:27 <skrm> you're so cheery today cam

19:51:36 <Camail> kinda
19:51:47 <Runbunny> I have been working a lot.
19:51:51 <Runbunny> Like a lot, a lot.
19:52:18 <Camail> the monkey's paw of employment
19:53:18 <Camail> but i'm sure you're putting all the income to good use by buying massive amounts of gacha rolls
19:54:02 <Camail> gotta keep the waifus sated
19:55:09 <Camail> i'm watching the gauntlet, ended up not giving it a third shot
19:55:28 <Camail> i abhor grinding, which is basically 95% of the gauntlet

21:33:20 <Camail> i love how most of the adblock tech on twitch now is just new methods of embedding the twitch player into the twitch website
21:48:45 <Camail> every once in awhile i think about how a teacher tried to stump the class on gendered words, when i guessed the female equivalent of aviator is aviatrix, he was shocked and he asked me how i knew...
21:49:32 <Camail> i couldnt bring myself to tell a highschool teacher that i just extrapolated from dominator/dominatrix 
21:49:42 <Camail> and just kinda... walked away without saying anything
