22:30:15 <Rial> hi hi~ 
22:30:40 <carcinisation> hi cane
22:31:28 <Rial> I wanted to ask, is there a particular reason why Discord isn't used more? At least for me, Discord is nice because it keeps a message history. East timezone here, so I bet I lose some good conversations, here. 
22:31:55 <Crisium> agree actually lol

22:33:57 <reification> oh boy my internet just bugged out
22:37:02 <reification> can't speak for others but i personally find irc nicer to use for text chat (discord is great for voice)
22:37:24 <reification> guess i've had decades to get used to it
22:38:46 <Rial> If only I had message history, that would help. I always feel like I missed something, here
22:38:54 <Crisium> same rial
22:38:59 <skram> so basically we're old and new things frighten us
22:39:05 <Rial> lol
22:39:12 <Crisium> im old and i use discord
22:39:38 <reification> i know some ppl just leave client running all the time 
22:39:58 <Rial> I'm heading out for work. Le tme know later how the topic developed, if it does. Sleep well
22:39:59 <reification> but pc noise would disturb me
22:40:09 <skram> cheers rial
22:40:12 <Crisium> gl at work
22:40:29 <Rial> ty ty ~
22:40:32 <Cane> Everyone here's on Discord anyway. This place is just the tradition.
22:40:42 <Cane> It's been here since, what, 2011?
22:40:59 <skram> yup
22:41:39 <Cane> If everyone stopped using it today and moved over to our Discord I'd be perfectly happy with it. I just think it's still fun to connect to IRC and say hi to the chat room.
22:47:26 <reification> i like that irc doesn't autoexpand twitter/youtube links else when i post a bunch of links it would take up a lot of space
22:52:14 <Cane> You can enclose a link with <> to avoid it autoexpanding, but that only works when you're posting it.
22:52:22 <Cane> I wonder if there's a setting that avoids stuff autoexpanding for you.
22:52:42 <Cane> I'm usually not a fan of the preview autoexpand either.
22:52:48 <Cane> So I usually put links inside <>
22:52:54 <Crisium> there is a setting
22:53:00 <Cane> Well hey there you go.

23:09:36 <reification> ah useful
23:21:40 <Camail> for awhile discord was pretty annoying, it's better now
23:21:49 <Camail> but like...i dont trust it as a stable platform
23:21:59 <Camail> like, for a decades old kind of community
23:22:07 <Camail> irc is eternal, discord is not
23:23:06 <Camail> and i have no idea how discord has money to exist, so i dont want to commit to it as the only place to talk to you guys for the next 9 years after the first 9 years
23:23:52 <Cane> Camail, re "i have no idea how discord has money to exist": Discord still hasn't found a way to monetize iirc, and are bleeding money, kept alive only through investors. If that ever dries up they might pull the plug.

23:24:02 <Cane> Not a big deal, migrating isn't too painful, but it could be the end of the community.
23:24:18 <Camail> yea you always lose people when you migrate
23:24:42 <Cane> On the other hand, QuakeNet has been here since 1693.
23:24:58 <Camail> i think the earth might've been molten still
23:25:39 <Camail> so yea, discord is the new thing and i'm cool with crossing between both
23:25:49 <Camail> but this place always needs to exist, it's the foundation
23:26:53 <Cane> As I said, if everyone else moved to Discord then no skin off my nose, I like it better in most ways, but it's also easy keeping this channel up and running.
