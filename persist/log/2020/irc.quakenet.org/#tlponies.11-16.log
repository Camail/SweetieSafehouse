16:28:50 <Cane> 'Allo!
16:29:48 <Runbunny> How's the north been treating you?
16:32:10 <Cane> Getting colder. At least exercise is less sweaty and painful, now I can just open a window.
16:32:30 <Cane> There are also several people in my small town currently self-isolating.
16:32:37 <Cane> So, waiting on news for that.
16:32:54 <Cane> How's things down there?
16:36:59 <Runbunny> It's you know, Corona virus and mink execution.
16:37:23 <Runbunny> Lots of work to do at least.

21:06:57 <Dot`> runbun, hob time
21:08:16 <Camail> that clip requires a lot of knowledge to be as funny as it is
21:10:01 <Camail> there are 3 levels, 1: man gets touched and immediately gives up before any damage is done 2: mvc3 has so many ToDs that he just lost in 1 second 3: he's a zero may cry player and cant do shit without his full team
21:32:12 <Runbunny> It's glorious.
21:56:43 <Dot`> runbun, this swaord saint guy doesnt even have a sword, he has a glaive like weapon
21:57:02 <Runbunny> He does have a sword O:
21:57:06 <Runbunny> And a spear.
21:57:09 <Runbunny> And a gun
21:57:55 <Dot`> so he is spear sword gun saint
21:58:10 <Dot`> GSSS
21:58:19 <Runbunny> Nah sword saint.
21:58:28 <skram> why does he have a gun
21:58:30 <skram> and a spear
21:58:42 <Runbunny> Spear and gun is standard equipment for a saint.
21:59:25 <skram> if you say so, bud
22:01:23 <Runbunny> Anyhoo it's time to sleep
