13:08:56 <skram> lads
13:15:20 <Rawr|Fone> Are you done with the painting skram
13:22:39 <BioPhone> Another day another dollah
13:23:26 <skram> not quite, henrik
13:23:40 <skram> should be done by tomorrow though
13:33:37 <Rawr|Fone> Good luck my dear
13:43:55 <Dot`> i see skram as a light blueish green lad, but norway is cold so maybe a warmer colour
13:44:24 <skram> ...
13:44:41 <skram> its a light greenish blue
13:44:48 <skram> :p
13:44:55 <Dot`> haha
13:45:05 <Dot`> really?
13:45:24 <skram> ye
13:45:32 <skram> dark red in the dining room though
13:45:45 <Dot`> maroon?
13:46:08 <skram> i guess
13:46:17 <skram> obviously its got some other pretentious name
13:48:42 <Dot`> female anime villian hair #16?
13:58:54 <Dot`> Bio, you play any tarkov?
14:06:21 <BioPhone> Yesterday? I did an offline run with scavs on for a bit
14:06:58 <BioPhone> Took one shotgun to the legs and he broke them both, blacked out one
14:07:15 <BioPhone> Hobbled over to dorms car extract and left
14:09:32 <Dot`> lol
14:09:53 <Dot`> im trying to do some factory runs to get back into it
14:09:56 <Dot`> offline
14:13:11 <BioPhone> A little too much cheeki breeki in factory for my taste
14:14:26 <Dot`> i turn bot numbers up to high and just use it for aim/listening practice
14:15:35 <Dot`> woods/shoreline is good for range/spotting
14:15:39 <BioPhone> Fair.
14:16:15 <BioPhone> I would like to practice with some armor, but I know not what to buy for a little nooblet like myself
14:16:51 <Dot`> the black armour
14:16:55 <Dot`> paka i tihnk its called
14:17:10 <Dot`> ill have a look in a bit
14:19:38 <BioPhone> I've heard armored rigs are ok too
14:20:39 <Dot`> yea i like them, also helps that most ppl wont loot them, as they dont allow armour, and ppl dont have the space for them
14:21:11 <Dot`> but also, more expensive than im willing to spend at the start
14:26:54 <Dot`> you cna get PACA body armour from lvl 1 prapor
14:27:02 <Dot`> Ragman*
14:27:18 <Dot`> and the SSh-68 helmet

14:35:19 <BioPhone> Yeh ill probably buy a set or 3 and get ready
14:35:33 <BioPhone> Maybe do a scav run somewhere
14:38:49 <Dot`> interchange i found the best for a bit of cash, but i havnt played since before that map was updated now i tihnk about it
14:43:47 <BioPhone> Feels so daunting trying to learn all these maps, he'll I still get lost at customs
14:45:27 <Dot`> they just updated customs!
14:45:31 <Dot`> more places to get lost
14:45:46 <Dot`> you always need to have a map open on your second screen
14:51:42 <BioPhone> Man even with the map
14:55:23 <Dot`> its certainly a major first step to getting into the game
15:01:39 <BioPhone> Def. I might do me some cheeki tonight
15:05:18 <Dot`> i originaly learnt interchange by mapping a route, testing it offline a few times, and then a bunch online
15:05:47 <Dot`> now that gives me a referance point for where i am
15:10:58 <BioPhone> Thats a good idea. I've heard the new area in customs has some decent stuff too
15:12:08 <Dot`> they do tend to buff the loot heavly in new areas to attract ppl
15:26:19 <Runbunny> Dot`, https://store.steampowered.com/app/1194840/Frog_Fractions_Game_of_the_Decade_Edition/
15:26:24 <Runbunny> It's on steam now.
15:27:31 <Dot`> is my spelling that bad?
15:28:45 <Runbunny> Maybe your fractions are the problem?
15:29:06 <Runbunny> Perhaps you'll learn something about yourself.
15:33:16 <BioPhone> The real fractions were the frogs we met along the way
15:36:30 <Dot`> Runbun, just remember fractions are reversable, 8% of 25 and 25% of 8 are the same
15:45:19 <Runbunny> :D
