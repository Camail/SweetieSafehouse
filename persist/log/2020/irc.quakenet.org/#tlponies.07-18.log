15:34:43 <Dot`> did you win your scrims dub?
15:36:30 <DuB`> Won more than we lost
15:37:17 <DuB`> After a handful of games we mixed up the teams randomly and my team won every one of those matches ;D
15:38:53 <Runbunny> reification, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDsQxVThqzY
15:39:02 <Bio> thats a lot of legos
15:42:01 <DuB`> True gamer vtuber with 2x finalmouse hehe
15:42:22 <skram> so high spec
15:43:33 <Runbunny> I am not sure how I feel about the background image of yourself.
15:44:21 <DuB`> Runbunny I think that's maybe not her real face
15:44:22 <DuB`> Maybe
15:44:39 <Runbunny> I choose not to believe your lies.
15:49:30 <DuB`> So pokemon x is so gooooood
15:49:38 <DuB`> Everything is so NICE and so CUTE and fancy and great
15:49:49 <Bio> dob pls
15:50:10 <Dot`> if i get an idea to play pokemon again dub, ill mark that as the one to try
15:50:15 <Dot`> i assume it has abra 
15:50:20 <DuB`> ofc
15:50:34 <Bio> it might even have kadabra
15:50:36 <DuB`> And a fire-psychic fennec fox starter
15:50:41 <DuB`> Literally the best
15:50:45 <Bio> oh right the furry
15:50:48 <DuB`> LICHRELLY
15:50:52 <DuB`> the best
15:51:14 <Dot`> not bulbasaur
15:51:21 <Dot`> so not the best
15:52:41 <DuB`> Having running shoes BEFORE playing for an hour is certainly nice, too
15:52:52 <DuB`> And now you get roller skates for more zooms!
15:52:58 <Bio> imagine a child not knowing how to run
15:53:03 <Bio> until getting shoes
15:53:56 <DuB`> You start the game in you pajamas with no shoes, but can still run! Indoors! I GASPED
15:54:39 <Dot`> but dont ride your bike inside

22:24:50 <Runbunny> It's probably for his mental health. Or maybe it's winning a game of Warzone (or whatever it's called) without taking damage.
22:27:13 <Runbunny> You're not looking forward to the crop top with bowlcut Dot` ?
22:27:50 <Dot`> im so tired of BR's though D:
