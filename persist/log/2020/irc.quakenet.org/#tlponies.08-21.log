00:46:00 <DuB`> So
00:46:20 <skrm> so
00:46:22 <DuB`> The crepe street across the street sells a "prosciutto, arugala, and melon" crepe
00:46:35 <DuB`> I thought "... there's no way that's good, right?" and was intrigued
00:46:37 <DuB`> I bought it
00:46:39 <DuB`> It was not good
00:46:44 <skrm> LOL
00:46:56 <DuB`> -$10
00:50:47 <skrm> just raw prosciutto?
01:09:24 <DuB`> ye
01:10:17 <skrm> i wonder who thought that was a good idea
01:10:33 <skrm> i'd rather have seaweed pizza
01:46:05 <Cane> God, Dark Souls is so good.

06:12:57 <Dot|Phone> No sirens yet. But the bus was nice and empty
06:13:23 <Dot|Phone> I saw ppl who dunt know how to wear masks..... 
06:13:27 <Dot|Phone> Don't
06:14:05 <Dot|Phone> I didn't think it was a tricky concept. But apparently the nose isn't connected to the lungs or something
06:14:17 <skram> did you stop doing driving lessons?
06:14:46 <skram> dont need the mask to cover your nose if you decide to not use your nose
