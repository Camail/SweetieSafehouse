20:10:15 <DuB`> I'm sure they do

20:12:00 <Cane> OG is a magical bastard team of magical bastards.
20:12:11 <Cane> Still gonna lose, but *damn*.
20:12:55 <DuB`> Too many lances :(
20:16:53 <DuB`> 2x rapiers > lances?
20:17:32 <Cane> There was a game in group play that had 6 rapiers, 3 on Medusa.
20:17:41 <Cane> This game isn't quite there yet lol
20:18:18 <Cane> Shame they didn't find a good level 4 neutral item for Gyro.
20:18:23 <Cane> They'll have to find a level 5.
20:19:06 <DuB`> O_O
20:19:07 <Cane> LOL
20:19:18 <Cane> HOW DOES OG DO THSI
20:20:34 <DuB`> Throw rapiers at them!
20:20:40 <Cane> THERE'S the third rapier on Gyro.
20:21:23 <Cane> GET.
20:21:23 <DuB`> ROFL
20:21:24 <Cane> WRECKED.
20:22:02 <Bio> the power of 3 rapier
20:22:04 <DuB`> When gyro spends 90% of the fight disabled but still wipes you
20:22:19 <Bio> aghs gyro, even when stun i still shot gun
20:25:55 <Cane> That was a thoroughly entertaining game.

22:05:27 <Dot`> providing a free bird to all
22:05:37 <Runbunny> Hmm.
22:05:41 <Dot`> but then hiking up the price of bird seed
22:06:00 <Runbunny> He's likely to keep everyone save by hunting the space monsters.
22:06:07 <Dot`> beggering everyone and buying thier houses at well below the market value
22:06:41 <DuB`> I've just been buying up mining + trading/freight ships and leaving it on while I work and having a bunch of passive income :P
