20:05:23 <Runbunny> Jonas.
20:05:28 <Runbunny> Bjørn.
20:05:33 <Runbunny> How can I assist you both?
20:05:50 <skrm> Just knowing you're here is enough, buddy
20:06:18 <Runbunny> You can enjoy some Shion then Jonas. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDE_dmntsTw
20:06:30 <skrm> We're worried you got the weremink virus
20:07:17 <skrm> isnt it kinda weird to just sorta hate a number
20:08:46 <Runbunny> But she is being all smug, as Shion does.
20:08:52 <Runbunny> So it's all right.
20:09:01 <skrm> too smug
20:09:27 <skrm> what do you want for christmas andersen
20:10:13 <Runbunny> A new pot. My old one is thoroughly loved and worn.
20:10:43 <Runbunny> I kinda forgot to make a wishlist.
20:11:06 <Runbunny> I did the whole family spreadsheet for wishlists and then just forgot about it.
20:11:14 <Runbunny> What about you Jonas?
20:11:47 <skrm> My brother's gotten weirdly into RGB houselights and his list was filled with things that makes light but in many colors
20:11:58 <skrm> I wished for absinthe and a sandwich maker
20:13:58 <Runbunny> Hmm. I would like to have like a chain of lights at some point. So that other people and children can look at it in the evening and be like: "That's pretty nice, I want a chain of lights when I grow older as well"
20:14:42 <Runbunny> Sandwich maker is a good choice though. 
20:17:02 <Dot`> add it to your list for next year bun
20:17:23 <Runbunny> O:
20:17:27 <Runbunny> I should do that.
20:18:29 <skrm> Whens your bday?

21:03:14 <Runbunny> It's perfect.
21:03:28 <Runbunny> Very good boy even.
21:04:07 <skrm> obviously not! He stole the other doggos food!
21:13:35 <Runbunny> We should ask an expert.

21:35:01 <Rawr|Fone> Not a good boy
21:41:12 <Camail> bad boy, even
21:41:30 <Camail> food aggression is where people get hurt
22:08:04 <Camail> holy fucking shit ads on twitch are terrible now
22:10:34 <Rawr|Fone> Are you sure cam
22:10:46 <Rawr|Fone> I love having to watch 6 ads in a row
22:10:52 <Rawr|Fone> That you can't skip
22:11:02 <Camail> these midrolls are insane
22:11:04 <Rawr|Fone> They are only 40 seconds each
22:11:12 <Camail> i'm ready to get a vpn
22:16:34 <Golly> surfshark, express, or nordic?
22:16:50 <Golly> you know, to support your favorite youtubers
22:17:19 <Camail> oh rawr, on mobile you can fairly easily skip ads but dont tell anyone
22:17:51 <Camail> exit out of the stream, re-enter, kill wifi/cell data, go to audio only, enable data again, then ads are gone
22:18:11 <Rawr|Fone> I won't tell anyone
22:18:38 <Camail> i've been doing it for years now, since they started doing ads with twitch prime
22:19:09 <Camail> they cant do ads on audio only at all
22:19:37 <Camail> then you just switch to video and its all good
22:21:47 <Runbunny> Anyhoo it's time to sleep
22:21:49 <Runbunny> Goodnight.
22:22:19 <Rawr|Fone> Good night Anders
22:24:44 <Camail> its also how i avoid pre-rolls on mobile

22:29:15 <Dot`> i napped
22:30:13 <Rawr|Fone> Camail, which weapon do you like best in hades
22:30:45 <Camail> Chiron aspect bow
22:30:50 <Camail> by far
22:31:14 <Camail> biiig power gap, its basically the only build i played
22:33:48 <Camail> second would be poseidon sword, third zeus shield, and fourth achilles spear
22:34:18 <Camail> fists and gun are just unfun to me
22:35:13 <Rawr|Fone> I think the spear and the fists have been the easiest for me
22:36:29 <Camail> spear seriously lacks damage
22:36:46 <Camail> the achilles aspect makes up for it as well as providing a nice full screen dash
22:37:13 <Camail> fists are good, just not my jam
22:37:30 <Camail> there's fun stuff there
22:37:46 <Rawr|Fone> Yes, the spear becomes much better with the upgrade that lets the dash attack hit three times
22:38:07 <Rawr|Fone> That plus any kind of boon to your attack and everything dies so quick
