22:46:19 <Runbunny> kabedon would have been cool though.
22:49:41 <Runbunny> I'll just assume that the combo they do is the highest dps one.
22:49:45 <Runbunny> Easy easy.

23:30:18 <Runbunny> I didn't do much, I finished up Doom, then an old friend texted me, and then I played CS for like 3 hours.
23:30:38 <Runbunny> I also made nachos.
23:30:46 <Runbunny> What about yours Dot?
23:31:28 <Dot`> i did work, then i did more work, and becuase i was being slow it took a long time
23:31:39 <Dot`> then i played some Borderlands with friends
23:32:56 <Runbunny> How's the borderlands holding up to my expectations?
23:39:03 <Dot`> it has bugs, main story could use a bit of work, but gameplay is nice and has a few improvements
23:39:37 <Runbunny> Neat.
23:42:08 <Dot`> and doom?
23:42:21 <Bio> rip and tear ect
23:44:17 <Runbunny> Well, doom is all right. There was some parts I didn't like, well mostly one enemy which I feel like break the phase of a fight.
23:44:59 <Runbunny> pace*
23:45:02 <Runbunny> idk.
23:46:23 <Runbunny> but at least doom eternal can run both doom and doom II.
23:49:31 <Dot`> i still havnt finished ori
23:49:37 <Dot`> stuck on a boss
23:50:29 <Runbunny> I still haven't gotten around to that.
23:50:59 <Runbunny> You'd think that with all this time, just being home, I'd get around to do stuff.
23:51:31 <skram> bruh
23:51:49 <Runbunny> Jonas.
