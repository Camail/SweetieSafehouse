16:10:16 <DuB`> Morn
16:11:06 <Dot|Phone> Dub dub
16:14:05 <DuB`> Got a 2DS XL for $100, time to play all the pokemon games I have missed out on
16:14:11 <DuB`> Haven't pokemonned since Emerald
16:19:10 <Dot|Phone> Nice! 
16:19:35 <Dot|Phone> Hey a balbasaur
16:19:37 <Dot|Phone> Get 
16:20:03 <DuB`> Need to decide WHICH games though... there are a lot
16:20:17 <Dot|Phone> Rawr knows best
16:20:24 <DuB`> Diamond/Pearl, Black/White, X/Y, Sun/Moon
16:20:37 <DuB`> At least doing the last 2 gens, dunno about the other 2
16:22:43 <Rawr|Fone> Sun/moon were boring
16:23:07 <DuB`> Another friend said those were the ones I HAD to do!
16:23:44 <Rawr|Fone> If you enjoy cutscenes and basically no gameplay then they would be ok I guess
16:24:45 <Rawr|Fone> It's just watching a cutscene, walking to a flag on the minimap and watching another cutscene
16:24:52 <Rawr|Fone> Fights are incredibly easy
16:25:14 <Rawr|Fone> Even if you don't use exp share, you will be extremely overleveled
16:25:18 <DuB`> Hm
16:27:42 <Rawr|Fone> Also the cutscenes are sooooo long
16:29:15 <Dot|Phone> Maybe dubs friend likes movies 
16:30:00 <DuB`> The important thing is it has the Abra line
16:30:06 <DuB`> ez
16:37:09 <Dot|Phone> Abra and bulbasaur are the requirements 
16:37:33 <Dot|Phone> Friend shaped
