01:26:38 <Camail> windows 10 update broke my display port, reverted the update and it works again
01:26:48 <Camail> i should've never left w7
01:26:49 <Cane> lolwtf
01:28:04 <Runbunny> O:
01:28:12 <Runbunny> But the vulnerbility!
01:29:15 <Camail> a whole lot of good the security does me when i have to use hdmi and stare at the god awful color quality and refresh rate
01:29:43 <Camail> i'd rather pick a usb out of a dumpster and shove it straight into my mobo
01:30:02 <Runbunny> Also. Reforge released, which meant that blizzard thought that my 2-3gb warcraft 3 installation should be 28gb+ instead.
01:30:18 <Runbunny> I don't even own reforge.
01:30:42 <Camail> das silly
01:33:17 <Runbunny> I'm mildly upset.
