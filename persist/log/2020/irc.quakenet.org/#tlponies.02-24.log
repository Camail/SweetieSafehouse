22:09:56 <Dot`> they are so pretty though skram
22:10:24 <skram> the panzer even has a skirt, Dot`!
22:12:13 <Dot`> so does a tiger, they are shorter

22:16:34 <Dot`> its a nice tiger but not the best
22:20:08 <Dot`> mmm, so many nice tanks
22:20:25 <skram> u pervert
22:21:04 <Dot`> pot kettle black
22:24:44 <skram> best tank is probably the bt42 though
22:27:31 <Dot`> the finnish? not the italian one?
22:28:40 <skram> the babby tanks are pretty cute but the finnish one got more style
22:29:28 <Dot`> i like the crusader 
22:30:30 <Dot`> and t34
