10:55:15 <Cane> Dot`, no I don't. I loved Anomaly (basically updated Call of Chernobyl for the 64-bit engine), but the latest update made it crash for me constantly so I haven't played in a long time.
10:55:35 <Cane> I was actually considering a playthrough (texture modded with maybe Arsenal or something) of the actual games for once.
10:55:40 <Cane> Since I haven't done that in ages.
