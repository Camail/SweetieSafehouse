16:32:15 <Runbunny> DuB`, I beat Ruiner nergio with the charge blade. 
16:34:13 <Runbunny> I comically messed up my first try. He had a skull and went to sleep, so I placed my bombs and the nearby wall clutched his hand, shot my pods, got thrown off, tremored and killed.
16:35:17 <DuB`> LOL and great job :D
16:35:24 <DuB`> Now we can augment up and be aaalll ready for next week
16:37:05 <Runbunny> I don't know how to get threat 3 mobs to show up in the guiding lands though
16:41:02 <DuB`> Quickest way to get things to chow up (besides lures) is to go back and forth between 2 expedition areas and just check what mons are in GL on the map
16:41:06 <DuB`> to show up*

17:14:55 <Crisium> check to the left of spawn
17:15:14 <Crisium> or did you mean you wanted to dupe them lol

18:02:56 <DuB`> hah
18:16:11 <Camail> pachelbel's canon is probably my favorite classical piece
18:16:40 <Camail> like in a top 10 regardless of genre, for me
18:18:18 <skrma> thats kinda interesting
18:18:35 <skrma> i think its kinda bland honestly, like lounge jazz or whatever
18:21:02 <Camail> the scales are just so pleasing to my ear
18:23:00 <skrma> well that chord progression is used in like every song ever made since
18:24:00 <Camail> i dont mean just the chord progression tho
18:24:10 <Golly> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b5B-9aCAeE
18:24:25 <Camail> like yea that's pervasive throughout the song, but thats just the underlying structure of it

21:47:41 <skrm> another absolute slapper
21:47:58 <Runbunny> Is your bird still there Jonas?

21:49:34 <Micen> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR0gOEyK6Tg

22:07:55 <Micen> i did a 100 card deck before back in the earliest days of yugioh. 
22:31:20 <Runbunny> Dot`, Hob is having a rough night.
22:31:31 <Runbunny> You should cheer him up by cheering him on.
22:31:35 <Dot`> yea
22:31:46 <Dot`> he was very silly in that oblivian run
22:31:54 <Dot`> got between allies and enemy
22:32:22 <Camail> man watching seagulls crosshair placement gives me anxiety
22:32:26 <Camail> my dude needs to chill
22:34:32 <Runbunny> Also was twitch always this mean?
22:34:41 <Runbunny> I liked it better when it just spamming emotes.
22:35:54 <Camail> fanboys be fanboys
22:39:41 <Runbunny> Aren't fanboys supposed to like whatever they're fans of? Instead of berating it.
22:40:07 <Dot`> its cool to hate runbun
22:40:21 <Dot`> dont you want to be cool
22:40:35 <Runbunny> Well not if it's like that.
22:40:55 <Camail> they are fans of something else
22:41:07 <Camail> and like to shit on this in order to show how much they like the other thing
22:43:14 <Runbunny> Hmm.

23:43:24 <skrm> i deleted mine because the pressure was too much
23:43:38 <Micen> i just keep a sticky note. 
23:43:40 <skrm> now i just rewatch the 3 shows i like ad infinitum
23:44:19 <Micen> Naruto, Bleach, & One Piece?
23:45:10 <skrm> panzer, toradora, slimesekai
23:45:13 <skrm> oh and yuru camp
23:45:17 <skrm> all of which are on your list lol
23:45:33 <Micen> haha
23:46:04 <Micen> Dorohedero is good. you should watch skrm. 
23:47:05 <skrm> hmm maybe
23:47:26 <Micen> At least the first episode. and like im not one to watch post credits stuff but it has a "in this episode we learned X" and some of it seems like the most random stuff 
23:47:40 <Micen> but if they are calling attention to it specifically, it has to be important. Right?
23:48:54 <skrm> Thats what they want you to think
23:49:23 <skrm> And then you forget the actual important bits and then you get properly whiplashd by the ending
23:49:31 <skrm> i think its directed by m night shamalamadingdong
23:55:31 <Camail> so skram, how are the fires now?
