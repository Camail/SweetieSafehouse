07:59:28 <skrm> tell your dog to stop snoring, micen
07:59:30 <skrm> bj√∏rn
07:59:43 <Dot`> Jonas
07:59:48 <Dot`> hows are my friends today
07:59:53 <Micen> He finally did. 
07:59:56 <skrm> still alive
08:00:15 <Micen> and im doing alright. Was just telling skram, trying to work on doing this content creation thing. 
08:01:11 <Dot`> haha micen, im hearing that a lot from another friend who took up twitch streaming during lockdown
08:01:25 <Dot`> well mostly complaints he doesnt know what to do for youtube
08:01:59 <Micen> well ive had my stuff for years. and i have plans and one notes. What kind of content is he doing?
08:02:13 <Micen> Also, im finally playing Ori and the Blind Forest. I should have done it years ago
08:02:19 <Micen> its so beautiful. 
08:02:41 <Micen> also i suck at the platforming. 
08:03:08 <Dot`> oh, i should watch that, ori is one of my favourite games
08:03:12 <Dot`> the atmpsphere is amazing
08:03:25 <Micen> I know, you were the reason I bought it on black friday a few years back. 
08:03:29 <Dot`> the music, the scenery, the art
08:03:39 <Micen> I think you even demanded i buy it. 
08:03:48 <Dot`> probably, haha
08:04:47 <Micen> im ~ three hours in. some of it is reminding me of VVVVV or SMB with the theres a way to do it, but youre gonna die a lot doing it 
08:05:18 <Micen> also i havent seen any gameplay/story/art aside from what ive already seen, so im completely blind. 
08:07:15 <Dot`> Oh micen, did you see itmejp's Roll Play is over for good. No more Court of swords
08:07:47 <Micen> No! I didnt!
08:08:54 <Dot`> Yea, i havnt watched the Q&A, but im guessing they couldnt go forward after what happened
08:09:13 <Dot`> I hope Adam does get back to DMing at some piont though, he is amazing at it
08:09:23 <Micen> Adam is no longer doing live content
08:09:51 <Micen> he is going to keep deving, and blogging, but he made a big post yesterday for the first time since the incident 
08:10:11 <Micen> https://www.adam-koebel.com/blog/2020/5/18/moving-on
08:14:05 <Dot`> Its really been blown out of propotion... what he did was weird and im not saying he shouldnt have been called up on it but wow
08:21:33 <Micen> I mean on one hand I get it. He screwed up in a major way.But on the other hand, people need to be able to say, I screwed up and be given a chance to grow from their failures. 
08:22:36 <Micen> Thats the problem with the whole Cancel Culture mentality. No one is given a chance to fess up and admit wrongdoing or learn from what may or may not be a genuine mistake. 
08:22:39 <Dot`> Did you ever end up watchign the clip?
08:23:56 <Micen> I did
