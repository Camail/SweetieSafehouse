08:01:25 <skram> good morning
08:01:30 <Dot|Phone> Friend 
08:05:14 <Dot|Phone> How's your face
08:06:04 <skram> not bad tbh, surprisingly well rested
08:06:24 <skram> arms bit stiff after lifting heavy things yesterday though
08:06:28 <skram> hows the you, doot
08:11:15 <Dot|Phone> Not recovered from the roughly 3 hours sleep I had Sunday night.

08:12:45 <Dot|Phone> Then maybe some hot water
08:17:58 <Dot|Phone> What's your plan for today skram
08:19:06 <skram> not sure yet
08:23:04 <skram> google tells me i have a bunch of compromised passwords
08:23:17 <skram> someones been posting weird comments with my imgur account and gotten it banned

08:33:32 <Dot|Phone> Lol
08:33:58 <Dot|Phone> I assume its a unique password? 
08:34:54 <skram> course not
08:35:04 <skram> thats why im changing every single password i have
08:35:57 <Dot|Phone> I got an email 4 days ago it seems from someone who has hacked all my accounts and got video of me, they threaten to release it if 8 don't pay them within 2 days of the email
08:36:20 <skram> sounds legit
08:36:23 <skram> send them all your cash
08:36:30 <Dot|Phone> I only just saw it. He should get better at emails so his don't get sent to spam
08:38:41 <skram> haha
08:42:59 <Dot|Phone> Less time updating his drivers on his viruses. Which he does every 4 hours so my none existent anti virus doesn't catch his malware
08:45:17 <Dot|Phone> Skram, new Of monsters and men song, wars, is pretty banging
08:54:11 <skram> eh its alright
08:54:21 <skram> i preferred the more folksy style they do
08:59:42 <Dot|Phone> Depends on my mood I guess to which I prefer. 
08:59:57 <Dot|Phone> You get all your passwords changed
09:00:04 <skram> think so
09:02:45 <Dot|Phone> Great

10:07:51 <Runbunny> Agreed.
10:08:44 <Runbunny> Jonas, I have seen a lot of talks from consultants lately. 
10:09:07 <Runbunny> vtubers are using the same talking techniques.
10:10:10 <Runbunny> Also, boob girl is streaming https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UcuMJf46g4
10:11:18 <Dot|Phone> ?boop
10:11:21 <Runbunny> This girl could also easily become a vtuber. She has all the techniques.
10:16:57 <skram> i dont know who that is runbun
10:20:40 <Runbunny> Boob girl.
10:22:08 <reification> she is mangaka for  ‰∏ñÁïå„Åß‰∏ÄÁï™„Åä„Å£„Å±„ÅÑ„ÅåÂ•Ω„Åç
10:22:21 <Runbunny> As Reif said.

10:26:07 <Runbunny> Henrik, are you coming to Copenhagen when Skram will be blowing up that power plant?
10:27:08 <Rawr|Fone> Hmm
10:27:23 <Rawr|Fone> Sounds dangerous
10:28:04 <Runbunny> I think it's a revenge scheme for all the danes Jonas had to work with.
10:28:46 <Dot|Phone> When is skram in Danish land? 
10:29:24 <skram> n e v e r
10:31:00 <skram> we're gonna blockade denmark
10:31:06 <skram> this is payback for terje vigen
10:31:22 <Runbunny> Probably in March or something.
10:32:30 <skram> well i was supposed to visit last fall, but the new boss decided no more fun times and cancelled the whole thing
10:33:02 <skram> fuckin' white shirt spreadsheet wankers
10:33:22 <Runbunny> That's pretty sad.
10:35:39 <skram> i cry everytime

14:49:27 <Rial> <3
14:49:31 <skram> <3
14:50:09 <skram> i have decided to do a bid on a house, Dot|Phone
14:50:55 <skram> and if i win it i should get a cat
14:51:27 <Dot|Phone> Gl horse! 
14:51:33 <Dot|Phone> Hey 2
14:51:35 <Dot|Phone> Get
14:51:36 <carcinisation> and then we should visit you both
14:51:41 <skram> :D
14:51:57 <skram> I wont know until the 23rd though
14:52:13 <carcinisation> oh it's sealed bidding?
14:52:30 <Rawr|Fone> Great news jonas
14:53:05 <Dot|Phone> So you will have a house if I visit in march? 
14:53:36 <skram> Well since a realtor has set up a public viewing of the property they can not accept any bids that run out before 12:00 on the day after the viewing
14:54:26 <skram> There was a first one in october and they didnt get any vids
14:55:25 <skram> I think all properties that arent brand new and sold through a realtor are required to be sold like this by law
14:56:29 <skram> We shall see dot, might get other bidders that jack the price way up when the deadline nears
15:12:44 <carcinisation> in the uk bidding for houses is almost always for trade not general public
15:13:09 <carcinisation> there are daytime tv shows about ppl who trying buying at auction and fixing up to rent/resell
15:14:03 <skram> Are houses just sold at a fixed price then?
15:17:14 <carcinisation> they have a list price and then you can make an offer which gets accepted or rejected by the seller
15:18:20 <carcinisation> the uk housing market has been a mess for some time, they are unable to build sufficient new housing
15:18:35 <skram> i see
15:19:42 <skram> Well its very different then, since the bidder has to accept an offer
15:20:44 <skram> When you sell, some person comes in and does a price estimate based on the condition and location and all that stuff and thats used as the listen price, but houses in some areas almost always go over estimate
15:21:12 <skram> but in this area houses are almost always under estimate because its in the country
15:21:37 <Dot|Phone> Silly city ppl
15:22:53 <skram> well im a city ppl now and its not so bad :p
15:23:08 <Dot|Phone> Lies
15:23:15 <Dot|Phone> You've been corrupted
15:23:34 <skram> having a 10 minute commute is pretty good
15:24:43 <carcinisation> buying a house in the uk tends to be stressful because of chains and gazumping
15:25:00 <carcinisation> so you are never sure you have a deal till the last second
15:25:07 <skram> gazumping?
15:25:37 <carcinisation> last minute higher offers
15:26:41 <skram> ah i see
15:27:22 <skram> well its not really a problem here since all bids are legally binding and known to the participants
15:27:50 <carcinisation> which is far more sensible
15:28:42 <skram> i dont know what happens to you if you make a bid thats higher than you can afford though
