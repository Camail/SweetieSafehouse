12:58:34 <Dot`> how was pingpong
13:00:11 <Rawr|Fone> It went well, but I can't train as much as I normally would right now
13:00:18 <Rawr|Fone> Only once or twice a week
13:00:34 <Rawr|Fone> So the quality of play is a little lower

16:53:23 <BioSC> hola
17:17:54 <Cane> EG.iceiceice
17:18:17 <Cane> Cr1t and iceiceice is an interesting offlane.
17:18:35 <BioSC> i thought icex3 retired
17:19:54 <Cane> Really? I heard a few months ago he was looking for a team.
17:21:01 <Cane> I wonder how they'll make it work. Dude has a wife and twin kids, doubt he'll want to uproot their lives in Singapore.
17:21:20 <BioSC> thats why i thought he retired =D
17:21:44 <BioSC> i remember watching streams of him with his whole family in view of his small apt or house or whateve
17:22:31 <Cane> lol same.
17:22:43 <Cane> I was watching him solo an entire lane as Timbersaw.
17:22:46 <Cane> Dude's disgusting.
17:34:58 <BioSC> fact
17:41:45 <Dot`> cane, how is cataclysm going?
17:42:15 <Cane> On break while I take the necessary two week correspondence course.
17:42:24 <Cane> You think you're a roguelike veteran and then Cataclysm happens.
17:42:36 <Cane> It's big.
17:42:50 <Cane> I also started working on my own games again, so less time for other games.
17:46:58 <Dot`> oh nice
