00:02:38 <Camail> house stuff is the giant money hole that adults all agree to throw their money into
00:02:46 <Camail> if its not houses, its rent
00:03:07 <skram> can i just spend all my money on pokemon cards instead
00:03:16 <Camail> you technically can
00:03:19 <Camail> no one is stopping you
00:04:09 <Camail> skram this just means we need to call dub jacob forever
00:04:15 <Camail> or jacathan
00:04:22 <Camail> jacefrey
00:04:25 <skram> he's gonna be mad
00:04:26 <skram> lets do it
00:04:40 <Camail> or J-money
00:04:54 <Camail> DuB`  which of those do you like the best
00:04:57 <skram> j-money is good
00:05:02 <DuB`> I was JDub before I was dub
00:05:18 <Rawr|Phone> I like J-money
00:05:29 <Camail> then its settled
00:05:41 <skram> jubathon?
00:05:46 <Camail> Jub
00:05:53 <skram> great
00:06:08 <Camail> .tag dub jub
00:06:36 <Camail> i put very little value in names, tbh
00:06:43 <Camail> hence my constant bastardization
00:07:02 <Camail> Adam has floated around over the years but i dont care at all what people call me
00:07:27 <skram> clamail pls
00:07:37 <Camail> shut yur face
00:07:58 <skram> sorry adamail
00:11:59 <Rawr|Phone> ü§®ü§®
00:18:50 <Dot|Phone>  Dub. Are we not friends? 
00:22:39 <DuB`> ???
00:22:53 <DuB`> If you really want to call me jake feel free, just not jacob :P
00:23:30 <Rawr|Phone> Jabbe
00:23:35 <skram> haa
00:25:09 <skram> r√§dda jabbe
00:31:05 <Rawr|Phone> It's kind of late jonas
00:32:46 <skram> its ok
00:32:47 <skram> im an adult
00:35:03 <Camail> TIL dub doesnt like any of us
00:35:05 <Camail> so rude
00:35:07 <Camail> and hurtful
00:35:19 <Camail> dot we decided his name is Jub
00:37:59 <skram> jubba the hut
00:41:40 <Camail> calling him jake must be weir for the nords
00:41:47 <Camail> hard Js dont exist for you

01:10:16 <Dot|Phone> Final raid of tarkov tonight sucked badly
01:10:55 <Dot|Phone> Went well, a bunch of kills, then because of a stomach hit earlier I ran out of hydration... Made it across the map to extraction
01:11:11 <Dot|Phone> Then died with 1 second left to extract 
01:13:10 <Dot|Phone> Also means I didn't complete the quest I was there to do

21:04:50 <skram> cam why are y ou such a rough boi
21:05:14 <Camail> because when i first tried to take a castle they beat me up
21:05:32 <Camail> so then i take their town and imprison all their friends
21:05:36 <Camail> fuck them
21:06:09 <Camail> they tried to pathetically take it back a few times then asked ME to make peace
21:06:14 <Camail> felt chad as fuck
