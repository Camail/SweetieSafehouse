00:55:56 <DuB`> Ye
00:56:01 <skrma> neat
01:06:52 <DuB`> Finished up territory, capital, and major geography labelling just today. (8k x 5k image) https://cardse.net/i/2020/09/05/ABMap-9.4.png 
01:07:33 <DuB`> Will probably go back and add "Kingdom of..." etc as I start fleshing out politics and such, and can't decide if I want to label more of the major cities or not
03:05:24 <Cane> I was wondering if you were still working on that. I've been looking forward to seeing your maps since I heard you were getting Wonderdraft.
