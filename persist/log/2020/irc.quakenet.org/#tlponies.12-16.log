16:27:10 <skram> DuB` I found a stupid thing that happens
16:27:29 <skram> If you hack a proximity mine to make it friendly and you carry an enemy corpse close to it, it asplodes
16:30:31 <DuB`> Hahahaha
16:30:37 <DuB`> That makes some sort of sense
16:31:04 <skram> they're already dead!
16:31:39 <DuB`> The mine doesn't know that!
16:31:56 <Dot`> stop carrying corpses around
16:32:00 <Dot`> its weird
16:32:02 <skram> well it should!
16:32:16 <skram> its called tidying up Dot`, its something adults do
16:32:34 <Dot`> well you should tidy up the mines first then
16:32:43 <Dot`> not safe to leave around
16:33:04 <skram> but they were friendly!
16:33:34 <Dot`> aparently not

16:40:02 <Runbunny> Hai.
16:40:05 <Runbunny> I was on the phone.
16:40:43 <Runbunny> I went to work, just having to fix some stuff then everything went to shit.
16:40:58 <Runbunny> and it's like 8 hours later.
16:41:10 <Runbunny> But!
16:41:28 <Runbunny> I bought myself some crisps.
16:42:58 <reify> bun https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/4252124
16:48:09 <Runbunny> Looks cozy!
16:56:35 <skram> i think i reached the end of the main quest DuB`
16:58:35 <DuB`> I haven't finished, and I'm on 50 hours now :P
16:59:48 <skram> naw im gonna do all the side jobs first

17:41:06 <DuB`> o cam you just missed my car-being-a-brat clip - https://youtu.be/m6bHWE9D0d0
17:41:46 <Camail> oof
17:41:49 <Camail> get rekt
17:42:01 <Camail> maybe its jealous of your other cars
17:42:32 <Camail> i'm starting a second playthrough
17:42:35 <DuB`> I can't help but collect them
17:42:42 <DuB`> hahaha
17:42:48 <Camail> pls
17:43:16 <Camail> going with corpo swordman
17:43:28 <DuB`> I've done exactly 0 melee in my playthrough, so maybe I'll start a samurai boi during the christmas break
17:43:38 <Camail> same
17:43:42 <Camail> i did everything else
17:44:03 <Camail> other than lmg, but lmgs kinda feel awful
17:45:00 <Camail> melee on very hard is taking some real effort on the early levels
17:45:18 <Camail> but getting mobility and health gain is gonna help with that
17:46:19 <DuB`> Wonder how useful the cold blood armor+resistance stacks would be for melee build, I know there are some melee dps buff perks in that category too
17:46:58 <Camail> i'm gonna find out
17:47:22 <Camail> going reflex>body>cool
17:47:35 <Camail> i'm impressed by the build diversity in this game, tbh
17:47:48 <Camail> its like if skyrim had actual combat
17:47:54 <DuB`> lul
17:48:10 <Camail> oh so i've fixed double tap dashing
17:48:23 <Camail> instead of removing it entirely, i just tightened the timing in the config
17:48:41 <DuB`> Sounds nice
17:48:42 <Camail> it used to be a .4 second window for any direction to be pressed twice
17:48:47 <Camail> that was miserable
17:48:55 <Camail> shortened it to .2, literally perfect
17:48:57 <DuB`> I haven't QUITE yeeted myself off of a building accidentaly, but have come close a few times
17:49:07 <Camail> i recommend changing it
17:49:45 <Camail> just go to the context input config and change a few numbers
17:50:06 <Camail> ironically, holstering is a tighter timing than dashing for SOME REASON
17:50:27 <Camail> the config says its because the script only runs for .25 seconds total for some reason???
17:50:47 <Camail> i WANT to increased the window for holstering but it has a hard cap
17:55:45 <skram> swerdz
17:56:40 <Camail> you a weeb too skram
17:56:55 <skram> i dont have an actual build tbh
17:57:59 <skram> I got points in body and int mostly but I use handguns and snipers
17:59:08 <DuB`> I kinda just grabbed every rifle/handgun perk with the words headshot, crit, or damage in it
17:59:18 <DuB`> O and stealth
18:03:35 <Camail> i spent most of my points on crafting and quickhacking
18:03:57 <Camail> i was able to essentially stunlock every enemy and boss in the game
18:04:23 <Camail> to the point where i messed up an important fight pretty badly
18:04:38 <Camail> epic quickhacks are kinda insane
18:04:47 <Camail> each rarity adds a new function to the quickhack
18:05:31 <DuB`> Oooh
18:05:44 <DuB`> I should also do that in my next, I have only basic quickhacks and no perks
18:05:44 <Camail> also crafting was just nutty because its free damage due to level scaling
18:06:04 <DuB`> Never done much besides ping, and reboot optics
18:09:09 <Runbunny> Soooo.
18:09:13 <Runbunny> Denmark is closed.
18:09:22 <Runbunny> I haven't bought christmas presents yet.
18:10:11 <Camail> f
18:31:06 <reification> amazon time?
18:32:59 <Camail> DuB`  were you aware of this https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/kccabx/hey_cd_projekt_red_i_think_you_shipped_the_wrong/
18:34:31 <DuB`> Ye I did that
18:34:53 <DuB`> Didn't notice much of a difference, maybe 5fps average increase but hard to tell
18:44:34 <Camail> guy V is less cool than girl V

19:09:03 <Camail> i saved barry this time woo
19:09:19 <Camail> that will make up for all the horrible things i'm gonna do, right?
19:14:05 <Camail> there's a perk on Body that regens health out of combat
19:14:15 <Camail> but food invalidates it....
19:14:24 <Camail> literally a 3 point drain for no reason
19:17:45 <Golly> theres a tech one that's supposed to hold the gun from firing, either it doesnt work or i dont know how to use it
19:20:09 <Camail> oh the top left one
19:20:24 <Camail> so it doesnt let you hold your charge?
19:20:38 <Golly> not on my pistol as far as i can tell
19:21:14 <Golly> i assume its supposed to hold untill you release the button
19:25:28 <Camail> yea it should
19:25:44 <Camail> maybe it interacts weirdly with the perk that lets you charge to 100%

19:53:21 <Camail> the hate on cyberpunk is voracious 
19:56:01 <DuB`> I just want a barbershop, man
19:59:26 <Golly> i want a warning when you dismantle a unique lul
20:26:29 <BioSC> i want a pizza

21:13:54 <Camail> swords are hard
21:14:02 <Camail> might go mantis blades
21:25:08 <Golly> dont think you can get those osha approved
21:50:32 <Camail> ok yea swords are trash in actual hard difficulties
21:50:39 <Camail> or at least until you get health per kill
21:56:46 <skram> poor barry
21:56:48 <skram> my only regret
22:01:33 <Camail> i thought telling them about the turtle would be a bad end
22:01:43 <Camail> because it would be belittling his depression
22:02:07 <Camail> but, because modern AAA hates putting explicit dialog options, its actually a good option
22:02:34 <Camail> mass effect really ruined it for the rest of us
22:02:52 <skram> i had a chat and the quest told me to come back in a few hours, forgot about it entirely, came back to my house and found his cop pals cryin outside the door
22:03:01 <skram> genuinely sad moment honestly
22:03:57 <Camail> ah yea, it is time based as well
22:06:30 <skram> cam is nocturne the final part of the main quest?
22:06:37 <Camail> yup
22:06:49 <Camail> you got there quick
22:07:10 <skram> only 25 hours
22:07:20 <Camail> yea i took 50
22:07:21 <skram> got a few side jobs to finish up though
22:07:28 <skram> not gonna bother with collecting cars i dont think
22:19:25 <DuB`> The promised blizzard has begun!
22:19:26 <DuB`> woohoo
22:19:45 <DuB`> Time to finish up work and prep the hot cocoa
22:20:38 <Camail> i just had a very fun emergent gameplay strategy moment
22:21:13 <Camail> bashing my head against a wall going againt 10 people with just a sword, until i hijacked a semi and rammed it up the middle, splitting the group into two 
22:21:52 <Camail> this game can be amazing and people just wont let it

22:26:03 <skram> a real cinnamon roll
22:26:15 <skram> despite him trying to kill you
22:27:27 <DuB`> I accidentaly only knocked once and got blown up...
22:27:37 <DuB`> FOUR. TIMES. V.
22:29:23 <skram> wonder if he ever found good yakitori night city
22:29:50 <DuB`> hehe
22:34:39 <Golly> gotta say, the storytelling in this game is some next level shit
22:36:40 <Camail> dub how could you
22:36:42 <Camail> four times
22:36:44 <Camail> it was obvious
22:37:21 <Camail> even the gigs have good stories
22:37:36 <Camail> just little bits of dialog to give character to functionally similar quests
22:37:53 <Golly> they even put johnny in a lot of em
22:38:43 <Camail> he's in side jobs, havent seen him in gigs
22:38:56 <Golly> could be, but even that
22:39:29 <Camail> yea there's a ton of johhny
22:39:53 <Camail> and its all meaningful characterization
