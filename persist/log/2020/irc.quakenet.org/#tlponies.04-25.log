09:25:43 <Dot`> im not a fan of gyms rawr
09:25:59 <Rawr|Phone> Hmm
09:26:02 <Dot`> and i dont have a car, there is nothign nearby
09:32:03 <Rawr|Phone> I think homeworkouts are better than nothing, but they are often vastly overestimated
09:32:23 <Rawr|Phone> Just getting fit is mostly about diet though

09:39:03 <Dot`> yea i know, my deit is ok, its not great but its on the healthier side
09:39:05 <Dot`> besides pizza
09:39:49 <Dot`> and most normal excersice is bad for me as it puts some strain on my neck
09:39:57 <Dot`> which i screwed up doing kickboxing
09:45:51 <Rawr|Phone> That does make it more difficult
09:46:23 <Rawr|Phone> Counting calories is the best thing that I have done in recent years though

10:06:36 <Dot`> ive thankfully always managed to maintain a certian level of fitness and not get overweight
10:07:29 <Rawr|Phone> I think counting calories would probably be even better when trying to lose weight reef reef
10:10:20 <reification> intermittent fasting is good for that rawr. the one surprising thing to be careful of is gout though!
10:15:44 <Rawr|Phone> Hmm, well even if you do intermittent fasting, if you are above maintenance you are still going to gain weight
10:15:54 <Rawr|Phone> Your window of eating is just smaller
10:23:54 <reification> yes, however it is hard to eat a lot in a short time
10:24:06 <Rawr|Phone> Very true
10:25:47 <reification> careful calorie counting is excellent for troubleshooting when things aren't working
