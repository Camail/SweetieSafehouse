16:00:30 <Cane> Broodmother vs Meepo.
16:00:42 <Cane> Two heroes that are almost universally picked as counterpicks, rarely seen.
16:01:08 <Cane> Anyway, go Taiga! \o/
16:01:12 <skram> "how do you beat the meepo" "There are ways" "cant talk about it now"
16:01:17 <skram> brilliant commentary, s4
16:02:10 <Bio> that awkward moment when you finish warming up leftovers

16:18:45 <skram> i think s4 might've been right with his claim
16:18:56 <Cane> s4 was the real galaxy brain all along.
