19:02:47 <DuB`> O no
19:02:51 <DuB`> Back to Greenest
19:03:18 <Dot`> if we rechase the cult do we get MORE stuff?
19:03:25 <Dot`> we even know where they are heading, easy
19:13:26 <Dot`> Dub, hows it going
19:25:08 <BioPhone> It means I've not done a whole lot during the work week, yeh
19:31:38 <skrm> Why dont we just do the first module again
19:31:50 <skrm> im betting we're gonna be better at it the second time round
19:32:50 <skrm> point 1: do not swat rats with swords
19:34:08 <BioPhone> Probs
19:42:12 <Dot`> but
19:42:15 <Dot`> what if we do
19:42:54 <skrm> good point
20:03:07 <Dot`> what doing skrm
20:03:46 <Dot`> Cane https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/igmoue/oleksiy_rysyuk_cartist_working_on_stalker_2/
20:05:28 <skrm> been running around trying to make things happen all day Dot` 
20:05:57 <skrm> did some real sketchy lifts with a crane
20:07:20 <Dot`> https://i.imgur.com/eOCtcxh.mp4
20:09:28 <BioPhone> V cool skorm
20:11:50 <Dot`> how big a crane skrammmen?
20:12:02 <Dot`> becuase i imagine its one of tos eones at the docks
20:13:56 <skrm> dimensionally pretty hefty but not that big in terms of lifting capacity
20:14:01 <skrm> WLL of a mere 9.5 tons
20:16:17 <Dot`> thats like 8 adultl read dragons
20:16:48 <Dot`> i cant type
20:16:48 <skrm> well, read dragons are unusually thicc due to their stationary lifestyle
20:16:54 <Dot`> adult red dragons
20:16:57 <skrm> oh i see
20:17:31 <Dot`> also i thought dragons would be heavier
20:18:09 <skrm> seems a bit small
20:18:19 <skrm> an adult big boi horse is like 900kg
20:21:38 <Dot`> ok, i tihnk that person missplaced a comma
20:21:42 <Dot`> 10 tons seems better
20:21:44 <Dot`> than 1
20:23:45 <Rawr|Fone> 900 kg is a very big horse
20:24:00 <skrm> there are some absolute units out there henriken
20:24:50 <Rawr|Fone> That is very true
20:24:55 <Rawr|Fone> Gym horses
20:25:05 <skrm> have you ever seen the d√∏lahest
20:26:06 <Rawr|Fone> I have actually
20:26:33 <skrm> massive lads
20:27:18 <Rawr|Fone> I have mostly been around icelandic horses
20:27:24 <Rawr|Fone> My sister owns one
