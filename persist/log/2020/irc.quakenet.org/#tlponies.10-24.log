22:17:12 <Rawr|Fone> Anders
22:21:59 <Dot`> Runbun!
22:22:03 <skram> Anders
22:22:06 <Dot`> no hob today
22:22:43 <skram> just tell them you've had a few too many doktor larsens
22:25:24 <Rawr|Fone> Skram
22:25:32 <Rawr|Fone> How have you been today
22:31:34 <Dot`> did he run away rawr?
22:32:02 <Rawr|Fone> Probably took a nap
22:34:46 <skram> Ive been pretty good Dot`
22:35:19 <skram> I had a special order on some gin but it got lost somewhere and now its sold out everywhere
22:36:03 <Camail> did it have a tracking number
22:36:12 <Camail> we can see if dot stole it
22:37:13 <Dot`> i dont drink, but i would look at runbun
22:37:15 <skram> What would Dot` do with gin? lamp oil?
22:37:37 <Camail> he gets satisfaction from denying yours
22:37:55 <Dot`> he has a point
22:38:18 <skram> Maybe he's just a giant weeb and he wanted to put it next to his lewd doll collection since it was a japanese brand
22:38:52 <Dot`> was it some vtuber branded gin skram?
22:39:20 <skram> If it was, there is no amount i wouldnt pay to have it
22:40:24 <Dot`> i have a printer, how much you willing to pay?
22:40:55 <skram> ill have to check with my loan guy in the bank but probably a million
22:41:31 <Bunny> Oh noes.
22:41:44 <Dot`> it cna either be a nice windows paint picture or you can pay extra for the hand drawn crayon art label
22:41:48 <Dot`> cover?
22:41:51 <Bunny> Doktor Nielsen, Jonas.
22:42:01 <Dot`> what you call the thing that goes around a bottle with the name on it
22:42:04 <skram> ah i see
22:42:11 <skram> label?
22:50:46 <Bunny> It's really good when you wake up and you feel like ass.
22:51:16 <Bunny> Early call to the doktor will fix you right up.
22:54:27 <Dot`> did you stop running?
22:55:17 <Dot`> im worred about him rawr
22:56:42 <Bunny> I am at work dot.
22:56:57 <Bunny> And therefor on a web client.
22:57:04 <Dot`> ah, no running at worl
22:57:07 <Dot`> work
22:57:15 <Dot`> while carrying dangerous viruses
22:58:21 <Bunny> Yes. Sadly the only blood I get these days is something that is sent to me by mistake.
22:58:47 <Bunny> I did, however, recieve a sweaty tell from 1¬Ω years ago.
22:59:05 <Bunny> You sent me this Dot` https://i.imgur.com/93RkQ4O.jpg
22:59:30 <Dot`> good swoots
23:01:06 <Bunny> Hard working little robot.
23:05:30 <Rawr|Fone> Dot, these horses should take care of themselves better
23:13:19 <Rawr|Fone> Especially dub and skram
23:14:38 <Dot`> hmm, very true
23:16:22 <Camail> Bunny you gonna try the zdps league? i'm in the queue
23:16:45 <Camail> all good skills banned, 40% more monster life, only white drops
23:17:08 <Camail> even more cursed than the melee league
23:17:27 <Bunny> O:
23:17:42 <Bunny> is there any info anywhere?
23:18:25 <Camail> bit.ly/35sDSG6
23:22:54 <Bunny> Looks like it could be fun. sadly I have 4-5 hours more of work.
23:23:06 <Bunny> Cobra Lash Pathfinder not banned though.
23:27:17 <Camail> cuz its hardcore and pathfinder is enough of a nerf
23:29:53 <Camail> i'm gonna do a cold dot build of some kind
23:30:36 <Camail> keep in mind a ton of utility skills are banned
23:34:12 <reification> night all
23:34:58 <Dot`> gnight reif
23:49:49 <Bunny> Yah. I probably won't find time to play it. I started a cold DoT build in the regular heist league, I think I'd rather just do that.
23:49:54 <Bunny> If I can find the time.
23:50:48 <Bunny> Anyhoo I go afk for like 30-40 min.
