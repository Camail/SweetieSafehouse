00:41:27 <Crisium> Camail_ all these FGC developments today O_O
00:54:28 <Camail_> Crisium its been hard keeping up
00:54:35 <Camail_> especially because i'm not as tapped in as i used to be
00:54:41 <Crisium> basically Evo 2020 is dead
00:54:52 <Crisium> all the companies pulling their support
00:55:16 <Camail_> a lot of the news is about smash ppl
00:55:49 <Crisium> it's mostly smash yeah
00:56:09 <Crisium> also Mr. Wizard from Evo has accusations involving enticeing minor boys to show nudity
00:56:15 <Crisium> so everyone pulling out of evo
00:57:00 <Camail_> yea
00:57:06 <Camail_> and mike Z is a dumb ass
00:57:12 <Crisium> is that new?
00:57:13 <Crisium> lol
00:57:16 <Camail> so skullgirls is in a weird place
00:57:48 <Camail> well yea when you make a george floyd joke on commentary, thats a new level of dumb
00:57:48 <DuB`> RIP EVO, RIP horsefight game at EVO
00:58:01 <Crisium> https://twitter.com/ManeSix/status/1278847031340130305
00:58:09 <Crisium> yea i was looking forward to horse fighter
00:58:27 <Camail> evo as a tourny isn't dead, the online attempt is over, tho
00:58:38 <Crisium> yeah it'll be back in 2021 for sure
00:58:43 <Camail> i assume they'll fire wiz and get back to it
00:58:43 <Crisium> but without Mr Wizard
00:58:46 <Crisium> right
00:58:55 <Camail> no more awful game reveals with him anymore
00:58:59 <Camail> thank god
01:00:49 <Camail> it worries me that the TOs are getting fucked over by wiz's actions, tho
01:03:59 <Camail> dub so are you caught up with CR
01:04:06 <Camail> cuz tonight is a new ep
01:04:20 <DuB`> ha no
01:04:30 <Camail> i'm shocked, truly
01:04:41 <DuB`> Watched a bunch but was busy last week or two, still on 72
01:04:44 <Camail> i completely forgot what they were doing, tbh
01:05:23 <DuB`> Kinda surprised they couldn't get an all-online setup they were happy with, but oh well
01:11:33 <Camail> its a theater group, online play wouldnt ever work
01:17:48 <Crisium> https://twitter.com/EVO/status/1278859734099963904
01:18:18 <Crisium> so yea Wiz fired, but Evo Online 2020 is cancelled
01:20:14 <Camail> according to the kotaku article wiz has tacitly admitted to it
01:20:25 <Crisium> his apology didnt deny it
01:20:56 <Camail> its the "young and dumb" apology, which is true, and he's not asking for forgiveness, which is also good
01:21:06 <Camail> so he's gonna take his lumps and we'll go from there
01:21:24 <Crisium> yeah looks like he did wrong, at least he is honest then
01:22:51 <Camail> siiiigh
01:23:09 <Camail> this is what happens when you have a wild west community
01:23:18 <Camail> people think they can just do bad shit
01:23:37 <Camail> smash is craaaaaazy tho
01:24:10 <Camail> i hope we don't have as many predators in the non-smash side
01:24:29 <Camail> ....i bet the hyperfighter community is fucked up
01:27:56 <Camail> there are a lot of people from mvc3 that i would not be shocked if they were accused
01:29:48 <Camail> WELP
01:29:55 <Camail> evo is canceled 
01:30:16 <Camail> and wiz is fired
01:30:22 <Crisium> yup, twitter from 13 mins ago i posted says it
01:30:27 <Crisium> cant you read :P
01:31:08 <Camail> my client doesnt highlgiht links so i glossed over it
01:33:00 <Camail> skullgirls will literally never main event an evo
01:33:07 <Camail> its one chance is gone
01:33:11 <Crisium> im most sad about TFH
01:33:15 <Crisium> woulda liked to see it at Evo
01:33:23 <Crisium> even if online has less prestige
01:34:25 <Crisium> people being scum is just the worst
01:34:36 <Crisium> they violate somebody (or some people)
01:34:42 <Crisium> and then procede to ruin Evo for millions
01:34:44 <Crisium> fuck you wiz
01:45:48 <Camail> yea every single one of the communities i am a part of has sweeping misconduct allegations across the board
01:45:51 <Camail> everything is on fire
01:45:59 <Camail> and we're all burning with them
01:46:27 <Camail> this is going to count as the worst year of most people's lives
01:47:18 <DuB`> SO glad my job is secure in the midst of all the 2020-ness
01:47:34 * Camail takes dub's job
01:47:52 <DuB`> ach
01:47:56 <Camail> mine now
01:48:00 <Camail> gonna keep it on my job vault
01:49:55 <DuB`> Hm
01:50:01 <DuB`> As long as I still get the salary part
01:50:08 <Camail> deal
01:50:12 <Camail> i just care about the job
01:50:16 <Camail> i hoard them
01:50:32 <Camail> my CV is like a mile long now
01:50:54 <DuB`> hehe
01:52:24 <Camail> ugh i just want it to be the weekend
01:52:44 <Camail> we're HALF WAY through 2020
01:52:48 <Camail> that is so fucked up
01:53:01 <Camail> febuary seems like it was a year ago
01:53:40 <Camail> covid proves how disrupting the status quo catalyzes change
01:53:59 <Camail> got people sitting at home with themselves, getting bored and irritable
01:54:29 <Camail> and actually spending time to self reflect
01:54:49 <Camail> and remembering that time wiz payed you $20 to see your penis and how that was kinda fucked up now that you think about it
01:55:26 <DuB`> Certainly a very full year
01:55:43 <DuB`> And so consistenly shocking
01:56:55 <Camail> also nuckledu got into a bad car crash
01:56:59 <DuB`> ya
01:57:05 <Camail> so hey our favorite fgc member could be dead for all we fuckin know
01:58:27 <DuB`> The lack of subsequent updates means it's definitely not minor
01:58:29 <DuB`> Worrying
02:00:30 <Camail> https://www.twitch.tv/criticalrole
02:02:59 <DuB`> Oh ok https://twitter.com/Dual_Kevin/status/1278867464357642240?s=20
02:03:03 <DuB`> Phew
02:03:08 <DuB`> Better
02:05:20 <Camail> woo
02:28:44 <Crisium> yeah feels kinda weird i quit my job in first week of feb before corona got big
02:28:47 <Crisium> but im glad i did
02:28:53 <Crisium> that job was killing me
02:29:52 <Crisium> just hope things get better and i can find one before i run out of monies
02:39:37 <Camail> here's hopin
