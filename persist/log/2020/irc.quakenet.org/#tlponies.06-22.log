00:00:06 <skram> GOOD DAY
00:10:40 <DuB`> I also got choco caramel cheesecake ice cream and some hint-of-lime tortilla chips, though
00:11:13 <skram> choco caramel cheesecake ice cream seems like it'd be a bit much
00:11:14 <skram> how is it
00:11:25 <DuB`> v yum
00:12:02 <DuB`> I think brownie chunks would be a bit simpler and preferable to the cheesecake flavor chunks, but still good
00:14:08 <skram> i want to buy an ice cream machine so i can make sorbets
00:14:14 <skram> the champion of frozen desserts
00:27:12 <Runbunny> Sounds cool Jonas.
00:28:11 <skram> eyy
00:31:32 <Runbunny> I'll see myself to bed.

14:00:21 <BioPhone> Did my guy die in that stun round after taking 50 dmg in one hit haha
14:02:02 <DuB`> Still less damage than you DEALT in one round, by a lot :P
14:03:29 <DuB`> Naw, the bigboss showed up on the far end of the room and since we're speedy we managed to nyoom over there and lock him down. Once he fell we were able to talk down the second wave of guards. Bear-halfling tried to run and do something bad to the hostage but we caught him 'n saved the day
14:04:32 <BioPhone> I didn't even get to crit smite too üòÅ
14:05:10 <BioPhone> That char for the like 15m I thought about him ended up pretty effective
14:14:07 <DuB`> hek ye
