19:27:53 <Runbunny> Jonas. Tell your boss that Dot gave you time off.
19:28:34 <Runbunny> Or perhaps that you'll work from home and build a nice big fire.

21:00:30 <Runbunny> Dot`, Rip.
21:00:39 <Dot`> yea, poor hob
21:20:18 <Camail> twitch got past ublock again
21:20:31 <Camail> time to use an alternate media player... again
21:21:21 <Camail> as long as they let subscribers skip ads, they cant bake in ads into the stream itself, so these players will always work
21:25:12 <DuB`> I had just noticed a day or two ago that twitch felt a bit less annoying... shame
21:26:34 <Runbunny> It hasn't gotten me yet.
21:27:19 <Camail> its a matter of time
21:27:42 <Camail> it supposedly starting happening 5 days ago, and another wave of people got it today
21:27:53 <Runbunny> Boo.
21:28:06 -!- BioSC [~BioPon@097-070-165-146.res.spectrum.com] has joined #tlponies
21:28:09 <Camail> its really a non issue, imo you lose barely any functionality with an alt player
21:28:18 <Camail> fuck them, i'd do a lot more just to block ads
21:28:22 <Camail> and have
21:28:58 <Camail> chat extensions work with alt players so all you lose is the ux features
21:29:12 <Camail> of which i had most filtered by ublock anyway
21:40:25 <Camail> oh cool, so cracked minecraft dungeons has a weird MS server emulation thing that just lets you play online with other cracked copies
21:40:31 <Camail> if anyone wanted to play

21:54:18 <Dot`> cam, ep 101 of CR, almost caught up
21:54:45 <Camail> nice, i think thats when they ended the hiatus, right
21:54:47 <Camail> or around there
21:54:54 <Dot`> yea, ep 100
21:55:06 <Camail> was it weird watching people be so close to each other
21:55:55 <Dot`> pre-Event
22:01:19 <Camail> i'm glad you back onto the show, cuz its about to get craaaaazy
22:02:38 <Camail> ok well alternate players dont work either
22:02:49 <Camail> they must have a team combing through community forums
22:02:50 <Camail> sigh
22:03:13 <Camail> fucking assholes dont even care about user experience
22:10:05 <Golly> would using different blockers together work?
22:10:56 <Camail> i dont think its a problem where layers would help, either something blocks their current solution, or it doesnt
22:11:27 <Camail> but hopefully since ublock people solved it once, it will be easier 
22:14:54 <Golly> I have adblock on top of ublock, and it seems to help. could be coincidence tho
22:22:15 <Camail> hmm, i think adblock just successfully blocks on its own
22:22:42 <Camail> the ublock fix is popular in the twitch social circles so it was probably targeted
22:23:05 <Camail> but i am prepared for adblock to be dodge at some point anyway
22:23:06 <Golly> makes sense
