12:26:24 <carcinisation> these euros and their silly metric measurements...
12:28:21 <Dot|Phone> Reif, stone makes NO sense
12:29:22 <Dot|Phone> It feels like cavemen with a stone that sits outside the cave and they compare themselves to it
12:31:39 <carcinisation> well until recently the kg was defined by a physical object dot
12:32:24 <Dot|Phone> Which is weird because it wasn't the gram 
12:41:33 <Dot|Phone> Reif, I just realised I haven't seen a scale that tells weight in stone
