19:10:37 <Camail> it avoids ads, while ublock figures out its filters
19:10:58 <Camail> firefox has something as well
19:12:36 <Camail> Runbunny  if you ever go spectres this league i have a syndicate operative spectre bank
19:12:45 <Camail> they REALLY suck to find
19:13:18 <Runbunny> I'm not much for spectres.
19:13:30 <Runbunny> Twitch sound is completely broken for me.

20:30:57 <Golly> a newer electromagnet technology that uses so-called high temperature superconductors that can produce a much higher magnetic field
20:31:32 <Golly> hmm, sounds too good to be true

20:57:06 <Runbunny> I'd wish they would link to the relevent scientific articles. Let me read the science myself.
21:00:32 <Camail> yea, the media has a fundamental disconnect with academia
21:00:44 <Camail> just two different goals with their information dissemination 
21:01:35 <Camail> but like, there's a low chance i'll know enough about any particular field to measure my excitement appropriately
