18:45:48 <Runbunny> Dot`, it's not.
18:46:03 <Runbunny> I got busy playing video games :&
19:25:34 <Dot|Phone> Rawr
19:26:18 <Camail> pls
19:26:32 <Dot|Phone> Cam why
19:26:38 <skram> I was just gonna do the intro to cyberpunk before i had to go out and get breakfast
19:26:43 <skram> it took like 5 and a half hours
19:26:49 <Camail> yea its a long intro
19:27:02 <Camail> its VERY witcher 3
19:27:17 <Camail> where you have a beginner region for the tutorial
19:27:34 <skram> i suppose so
19:31:12 <Camail> i'm at the end of cyberpunk
19:31:44 <skram> what background did you do?
19:31:46 <skram> at the start
19:31:51 <Camail> i am having that classic rpg moment where you just stop playing the game because commitment is scary
19:31:55 <Camail> i did streetkid
19:32:18 <Rawr|Fone> DoT
19:32:19 <Camail> figured i'd be spending most of my time o the streets so might as well be from there
19:32:29 <Camail> rawr dot talk to him like that
19:32:33 <Camail> be respectful of your elders
19:32:35 <skram> wonder how much the start matters or how different they are
19:32:50 <Rawr|Fone> Snela cam
19:33:02 <Golly> pretty happy with corpo so far
19:33:23 <Camail> i have an answer for that skram, but was it a rhetorical question
19:33:30 <skram> yeah corpo is cool
19:33:48 <skram> hmm both i suppose?
19:33:54 <Camail> i've enjoyed streetkid a lot, it's exactly what i wanted it to be
19:33:55 <skram> i am gonna try the other two
19:34:15 <Camail> from what i can gather, background influence an occasional dialog choice

19:34:51 <Camail> each origin gives you different knowledge that your character can use in side jobs, mostly
19:35:03 <skram> ya it does pop up often
19:35:09 <skram> especially in the last bit of the intro
19:35:21 <Camail> well the last bit of intro is VERY corpo
19:35:28 <Camail> i didnt get any for that part
19:35:29 <skram> yuup
19:35:53 <Camail> so do you understand a bit more about keanu now
19:35:56 <Camail> and how its hard to talk about
19:36:02 <skram> hah
19:36:02 <skram> yes
19:36:35 <skram> i hope the reason why he's like that gets explained at some point
19:36:58 <Camail> the one thing i'll say, is that cyberpunk hates hope
19:37:04 <Camail> i've never played a more cynical game
19:37:22 <skram> no happy ending huh
19:37:25 <Camail> i feel like everything i do is wrong
19:37:31 <Camail> i dont know i ahvent beaten it yet
19:37:48 <Camail> oh wait no, i've done one thing right

19:42:01 <Camail> my hacking is nuts
19:42:29 <Camail> i can kill anyone in two RAM from like 30m away, its great
19:43:30 <Camail> but yea after 58 hours i'm kinda sick of the breaching puzzle
19:43:38 <Camail> its mostly because it doesnt get any harder
19:43:46 <Golly> i hate when theres many in a row
19:43:50 <Golly> hard ones at least
19:44:05 <Golly> that is hard in the sense of getting all 3
19:44:12 <Golly> for the $
19:44:15 <Camail> yea but is it always possible?
19:44:20 <Camail> sometimes i feel like they cant be
19:44:27 <Camail> so i usually go for the bottom 2
19:44:29 <Golly> mostly, i have 8 buffer tho
19:44:40 <Golly> sometime impossible yea
19:44:52 <Camail> 8 buffer solves a lot of it yea, but i have 7 because the one i have has more ram
19:44:58 <Camail> and i like using ultimate quickhacks a lot
19:45:51 <Camail> the WORST are when you cant find a way to do it with the top row, but the solution needs n-1 so you know you can essentially start from anywhere
19:45:52 <Golly> i started with a hacker style but transitioned into just gunnin
19:46:01 <Camail> i stopped going for those because its too time consuming for 300 creds
19:46:42 <Camail> i'm hybrid guns/hacking, firefights are a pain when you die in 2 hits
19:47:00 <Camail> but hacking is so strong that i kinda end up killing everyone before i need to shoot them
19:47:28 <Camail> contagion is just so strong cuz it stacks

21:02:44 <Rawr|Fone> You are fantastic jonas
21:22:46 <skram> <3
21:41:58 <DuB`> O boi skram is playing superbonk
21:42:37 <skram> heck ye
21:45:17 <DuB`> I was playing with settings yesterday and got so confused
21:45:42 <DuB`> I usually am between 50-90 fps and wanted to see if I could squeeze some more out by turning settings down
21:45:52 <DuB`> Started incrementally moving things down but didn't notice much change
21:46:02 <DuB`> So slapped everything down to low... still  50-90
21:46:03 <DuB`> wat
21:46:20 <DuB`> So then I turned to ultra-max-rtx mode... still 50-90
21:46:21 <Camail> cpu bound
21:46:33 <Camail> those are all mostly gpu settings
21:46:52 <DuB`> ya
21:47:13 <Camail> dub have you beaten it yet
21:47:14 <DuB`> Surprised that i7 8700k would limit so hard, it never has before
21:47:30 <Camail> its just a heavy cpu game
21:47:31 <DuB`> I have max street cred and fancy cars and... no :P
21:47:33 <Camail> some just are
21:47:42 <Camail> i only have the fastest car
21:47:48 <Camail> and i kinda hate it???
21:47:51 <Camail> the handling is so hard
21:47:54 <Camail> but it hits 206
21:47:58 <Camail> zoooom
21:48:08 <DuB`> Sounds so good
21:48:16 <Camail> it sounds weird
21:48:18 <DuB`> I like the car handling haha
21:48:24 <DuB`> Powerslides so satisfying
21:48:25 <Camail> the handling of the heavier vehicles is easy
21:48:36 <Camail> its just temperamental
21:48:45 <Camail> i'm used to having to use the handbrake to drift in this game
21:48:58 <Camail> but you dont even need to if the car is light enough
21:49:16 <DuB`> That much horsepower will spin your wheels for sure haha
21:49:39 <Camail> the car interiors are pretty nice
21:50:15 <Camail> i ahvent played at all today because once i start i'm gonna be done =/
21:50:39 <skram> i get 55-60 with a 1080 DuB`
21:50:43 <Camail> i came in with 20 int, and i think that's relevent to V's situation so i'm hoping i get right on that
21:51:03 <DuB`> The caliburn interior is super nice, but so hard to see out of lol
21:51:10 <DuB`> The front console is so tall
21:51:31 <Camail> yea i rarely go first person
21:51:54 <Camail> the fact that it doesnt have a rearview sets off redflags for me as a human
21:52:09 <Camail> i cant function without the window, just as a reflex
21:52:49 <Camail> i wish this game came out last year
21:53:03 <Camail> all the USA class tensions really makes some of these decisions really sad
21:56:32 <skram> riding with npcs trip me up man
21:57:00 <skram> in corners they turn the wheel like like 15 degrees and the car does a friggin hairpin turn
21:57:04 <skram> immersion ruined
21:57:11 <DuB`> Haha
21:57:19 <DuB`> They also turn at full speed and very late
21:57:44 <DuB`> "You're gonna, whooaaah... you're gonna hit the.... ahhh"
21:58:58 <Golly> fun tip - if an npc is gonna take over a car after you
21:59:08 <Golly> put it in a tough spot
21:59:16 <Golly> and prepare for lulz
22:03:41 <Camail> i have an npc just straight up run over a person
22:03:45 <Camail> i felt every bump
22:03:49 <Camail> then we got out
22:04:13 <Camail> oh i had a fun bug
22:04:22 <Camail> i called an npc and they... they just appeared
22:04:42 <Camail> instead of loading the model off screen to put in the call UI, she was just there in front of me
22:04:55 <DuB`> Haha
22:04:59 <Camail> and i got both her voice and the phone voice double speaking to me
22:04:59 <DuB`> "... you called?"
22:05:06 <Camail> i ran away to try and despawn her
22:05:26 <Camail> but she was stuck there even after using quick travel
22:08:21 <BioSC> asdfjkl;
22:08:26 <BioSC> geevenin
22:09:19 <DuB`> gvevin
22:12:52 <BioSC> gonna be a busy week
22:13:01 <BioSC> but hey, vacation startin friday evening
22:17:45 <Camail> i find it mildly silly that there is a weapon mon that just makes your bullets not kill
22:17:50 <Camail> like ??? what?
22:18:05 <Camail> all of a sudden thats not real blood? am i pullin punches?
22:18:21 <Camail> i shot a dude in a  face with a revolver, but nah he's good
22:18:33 <Camail> mod*
22:20:20 <DuB`> Lorewise weird, but they certainly have their use
22:20:43 <DuB`> Hard to nonlethal people when you do like 5k dmg per shot, and yours fists do like... 40 damage
22:23:11 <Camail> hacking or blunt weapons
22:23:45 <Camail> its just weird to modify a lethal gun to a non-lethal is just a toggleable manner
22:23:56 <DuB`> ye
22:34:05 <Golly> also dead npcs move like they're just unconcious after
22:34:16 <Golly> makes it real confusing when the goal is not to kill
22:38:05 <Camail> i've never had that
22:38:14 <Camail> any moving body i've double tapped has taken damage and given xp
22:38:28 <Camail> and i have double tapped a ton of bodies
22:43:12 <Golly> hm, youre saying theres a state where they go down but arent dead
22:43:19 <Golly> but you can loot them
22:43:57 <Golly> after using a lethal weap
22:52:33 <Camail> hmmm
22:52:40 <Camail> i got this cool, narratively meaningful piece of armor
22:52:48 <Camail> but its 1000% worse than my stuff
22:52:52 <Camail> this is a conundrum
22:53:19 <Camail> Golly  its complicated, because some damage types arent lethal
22:53:29 <Camail> as far as my understanding goes
22:53:48 <Golly> hm I see
22:53:50 <Camail> but if they get downed and can still take damage, they weren't dead
22:54:28 <Camail> electrical isn't lethal, i dont believe
22:55:05 <Camail> i just know that i can accidentally not kill anyone, but i'm using a lot of damage sources
22:55:48 <Golly> game logic, shoot a guy for 99% hp, 1% electric
22:55:51 <Golly> not dead lol
22:56:03 <Camail> yea the killing blow is what determines it, that i know
22:56:58 <Runbunny> Sleep time.
23:00:02 <Golly> is it bad that i feel bad for not killing as much as I thought
23:00:50 <Camail> depends on the people
23:01:01 <Camail> civilians? yea. corpos? maybe.
23:07:52 <Golly> im also worried that the game will suddenly judge you at the end, for being a murder hobo
23:10:42 <Golly> its odd to play a game where youre given the choice but it mostly doesnt seem to matter
23:10:51 <Golly> when similar games make a big deal of it
23:15:00 <Camail> i've come across a few times where its mattered
23:15:19 <Golly> for the named ones maybe
23:15:20 <Camail> but i dont think the end will be a big undertale judgement
23:16:10 <Camail> your character is already a killer, and johnny is a biiiig killer
23:16:19 <Camail> i dunno if they'd moralize it
23:17:05 <Camail> and this'll be the last time i'll get to talk about if for like 6 months cuz i'm just about there
23:26:51 <Golly> doesnt seem like a cyberpunk thing to do no
23:27:35 <Camail> this game is so hellbent, its more punk than cyber
23:27:44 <Camail> and its REALLY cyber
23:29:37 <Golly> https://twitter.com/Oceanity/status/1338576850159857665
23:39:39 <Golly> its not hitting me as hard as you, but that probably because i watch a lot of WH40k lore stuff
23:43:31 <Camail> doing a mission "V watch them, alright" *they drive their van into me* "copy that!"
23:43:38 <Camail> what the fuck rude
23:44:38 <Golly> hehe
23:44:40 <Camail> reading it is different from playing it, i guess. I'm trying to make good decisions while people are telling me to burn the world or to sell my soul
23:45:41 <Golly> currently im mostly working on tryin to score with panam
23:45:49 <Camail> oh also if anyone hasnt disable double tap dashing yet, i suggest it
23:46:02 <Camail> gotta go into a config but its worth
23:46:12 <Camail> i kept dashing out of stealth early on
23:46:23 <Golly> do you just not use it at all
23:46:38 <Golly> or did you set a button
23:47:25 <Camail> i dont dodge at all
23:47:34 <Camail> but you can use other methods i think
23:47:39 <Camail> dunno never needed to learn
23:47:57 <Camail> its not a good mechanic because melee attacks are tracking 
23:48:05 <Camail> so i opt to kill things before they get close, or sprint away
23:48:12 <Golly> ive only really used it on a couple boss fights
23:48:18 <Camail> nothing in the game has been able to catch up to my sprint
23:48:26 <Camail> even the super duper fast bois
23:51:29 <Golly> for some reason ive stubbornly stuck with a ricochet setup, but its hard to make use of
23:52:10 <Golly> havent tried smart, tech shooting through stuff seemed superior tbh
23:53:16 <DuB`> Ping-hack everyone and then blast them with 60k crits through 4 concrete walls with a militech sniper has certainly become the easiest way for me to clear things :P
23:55:03 <Golly> fair and balanced
