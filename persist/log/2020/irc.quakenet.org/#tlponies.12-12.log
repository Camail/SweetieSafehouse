18:35:49 <Dot`> swoots!
18:48:53 <Camail> yup
18:50:21 <Camail> hmm
18:50:30 <Camail> started up cyberpunk
18:50:36 <Camail> alt tabbed, and it hard crashed
18:50:41 <Camail> good strat to the day
18:50:45 <Camail> start.

18:58:36 <DuB`> Decided to finally buy a new car in the game, but can't decide if I want the 75k corvette-lookin one now or keep saving a bit for the 160k hypercar which will be available in 3 more street cred...
19:01:31 <Golly> I'd wait 
19:01:43 <Golly> spent all my buckaroos on double jump
19:01:47 <Golly> worth it to
19:04:58 <DuB`> Rip monies
19:05:12 <DuB`> Worth if for superlegs and luxury cars

19:10:35 <skram> i am hom
19:20:15 <Golly> sweat hom
19:23:08 <Dot|Phone> Huzzah skram
19:27:59 <Camail> i am borderless windowed, dunno why losing focus caused it to crash
19:28:58 <Camail> i spent a good chunk on some clothing mods, but being immune to shock and poison might be nice
19:29:37 <DuB`> I was surprised how OP some clothes mods are
19:29:52 <Camail> i get 200 armor just from my coat
19:29:55 <DuB`> Like, more armor from the mod than the clothing itself, or +20% dmg buff
19:30:10 <Camail> the 30% crit damage is nice for when you get the good guns
19:30:16 <Camail> that have base 30% crit chance
19:30:33 <Camail> even on max difficulty you still kinda tear through people
19:31:45 <DuB`> I got some 15k dmg stealthed headshot pistol crits
19:31:46 <DuB`> pewpew
19:32:11 <Camail> stealth is nice cuz you dont have to invest in it almost at all
19:32:29 <Camail> i have points spread in shooting/hacking/crafting
19:32:54 <Camail> just enough body to pick up a sniper, and cool is just a mega dump stat
19:33:15 <Camail> trying to snipe without 6 body is hilarious
19:36:34 <Camail> and wait, DuB`  did you look up the cars you get and which cred you get them at
19:36:38 <Camail> you nerd
19:37:04 <DuB`> Well
19:37:05 <DuB`> Yes
19:37:18 <DuB`> I have 120k saved and wanted to know if I should hold on to it or not!
19:37:55 <Camail> nerrrd
19:37:58 <Golly> do the clothing stores sell the mods?
19:38:15 <Camail> yea
19:38:25 <Camail> the immunity one cost like 10k each or something
19:38:35 <Camail> i spent like 40k on my one and only shopping trip
19:40:52 <Golly> is there a way to salvage a mod once youve placed it?
19:44:02 <Camail> nope
19:44:12 <Camail> so you gotta be careful with the big ones
19:50:17 <DuB`> I've only seen a non-tech sniper once, and it was a legendary in the shop that I couldn't afford at all
19:50:19 <DuB`> Hmph
19:55:46 <Camail> hmm, any sniper enemy will have one
19:56:08 <DuB`> They're all tech nekomatas!
19:56:17 <Camail> oh right thats the one
19:56:22 <DuB`> Maybe I need to expand to different areas more
19:56:25 <Camail> i have a blue craftable one
19:56:30 <Camail> as well as an iconic
19:56:35 <Camail> from a thing i did
19:56:37 <DuB`> ooh
19:56:58 <Camail> i have an iconic revolver, charge rifle, and sniper
19:57:14 <Camail> but that also means i gotta grind out the legendary version
19:57:29 <Camail> gotta get a few more levels in crafting before that
19:58:07 <Camail> are you just running aorund doing side jobs
19:58:17 <Camail> cuz i've done things in every zone, just about
19:58:41 <DuB`> Done a lot, but not "just"
19:58:44 <Camail> i got the sniper blueprint off a weapons vendor

20:10:33 <Camail> dot is crab 
20:10:36 <Camail> he has been
20:13:51 <skram> snip snip, bitch
20:21:07 <Camail> tech weapons are insanely good tho
20:21:22 <Camail> being able to wallhack, then just...shoot their heads through the wall
20:21:40 <Camail> i have yet to even figure out how to ricochet because i just use straight lines
20:23:07 <BioSC> whattr my nerd horses up to
20:24:38 <Camail> i wanted to say something funny
20:24:44 <Camail> but it would spoil a fun side job
20:24:59 <Camail> but just know i had a funny thing to say
20:25:01 <Camail> pls know
20:28:49 <skram> BioSC https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFxXK603sHI
20:30:19 <Camail> oh cool the gun i picked up wasnt scale to my level
20:30:31 <Camail> fun doing 10 damage
20:30:42 <DuB`> I've seen some of those haha
20:44:21 <Camail> my ultimate quickhacks did most of the heavy lifting in that case
20:48:37 <DuB`> Stealth is pretty convenient when you can just hack into people's eyeballs and turn them off!
20:53:19 <Camail> DuB`  hey dont do "sweet dreams" i'm pretty sure its bugged
20:53:28 <Camail> and if it isn't bugged, its anti-fun
