13:21:48 <Rawr|Fone> Hmm
13:27:13 <Dot|Phone> What about you Rawr
13:28:12 <Rawr|Fone> More ui stuff today
13:28:18 <Rawr|Fone> CSS is the worst
13:28:54 <Dot|Phone> I don't use it. My ui is loi and scada, drag and drop mostly
13:29:44 <Rawr|Fone> The dream
13:31:02 <Dot|Phone> Until you swap from design mode to user mode and things that lines up shift for no damn reason
13:31:17 <Dot|Phone> So you swap back and they are still lined up in design
13:32:00 <Rawr|Fone> I can relate
