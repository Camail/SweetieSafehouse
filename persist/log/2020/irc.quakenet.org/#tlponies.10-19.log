10:06:47 <Runbunny> Dot`, Video games and politics. Maybe.
10:08:35 <Runbunny> Apparently some danish politician licked on some interns.
10:09:38 <Dot`> you should not lick ppl without consent bun
10:09:48 <Dot`> thats like rule no.1

10:16:03 <skram> Bj√∏rn pal, anders just called me a thing
10:16:13 <Runbunny> Jonas.
10:16:33 <skram> Anders.
10:16:34 <Runbunny> The thing was actually that you're not allowed to lick people without consent. 
10:18:09 <skram> You're not allowed to lick people without context, either
10:31:10 <reification> dotties!
10:37:50 <reification> i searched for runbun's licking news and got this instead: https://www.menshealth.com/health/a19524671/testicles-are-strong-faq/

11:09:29 <skram> i'd call hospitalization a forced vacation tho
11:09:30 <Runbunny> Don't even think about it.

22:13:38 <Runbunny> Pretty standard. 
22:14:04 <Runbunny> Lab staff is not doing stuff in a fashion that makes it easy for me.
22:14:10 <Runbunny> So I get to sit around and wait a lot.
22:14:39 <skram> Tell em to shape the heck up

22:39:03 <skram> Some sticks
22:39:27 <skram> And a big ass cooking surface thing
22:39:50 <DoT`> like one of those large flat heated things
22:39:57 <DoT`> that fancy chefs use?
22:40:23 <DoT`> is it a weeb food?

22:44:00 <Runbunny> Rosti is nice.
22:44:25 <skram> do you eat rakfisk in denmark anders
22:44:30 <Runbunny> This seems more like flatbread though
22:44:31 <skram> or any other form of rotten fish
22:45:08 <Runbunny> Nah, just smoked fish and moldy cheese
22:45:10 <skram> its soft flatbread basically ranban

23:02:28 <DoT`> runbun, hob is losing it
23:06:37 <skram> isnt he always losing it
23:08:43 <DoT`> its a matter of comparison, hes very far gone, so its how far beyind that he is currently
23:09:19 <DoT`> he just lost 3 runs right at the start after losing one late in to a stupid mistake
23:14:30 <reification> night all
23:15:13 <skram> gnight reifen

23:18:15 <Runbunny> Hob is starting to feel the pressure of his bet.
23:19:07 <Runbunny> Mind of an asparagus that one. 
23:19:33 <DoT`> has he not just accepted at this point he wont get it
23:19:45 <DoT`> and will be bold for his wedding, with a weird tattoo
23:21:15 <Runbunny> The tattoo chosen by chat is the worst part. If the bet didn't include that it would have been fine.
23:21:49 <DoT`> i dont know why anyone would add that to a bet

23:49:40 <Camail> fuck man, my anxiety is skyrocketing about the us election
23:49:59 <Camail> i dont know if i can handle the possibility of trump winning
23:50:14 <Camail> even the smallest iota sparks panic 
23:50:35 <Camail> gotta stay away fro reddit and imgur the next two weeks
23:51:01 <skram> Ya do your voting and then take a break from news
23:51:19 <Camail> i already voted
23:51:20 <skram> think most of the world is pretty anxious about this, too
23:51:50 <Camail> luckily my vote doesnt mater because illinois goes blue
23:52:18 <Camail> so i have very little federal political responsibility 
23:52:56 <Camail> i have so little faith in the intelligence of trump supporters
23:53:05 <Camail> since 2012 he has been a bastion for gullible fools
23:53:50 <skram> its a giant cult of people who've traded critical thought for... something?
23:53:56 <skram> dunno
23:53:59 <skram> fuck that guy
23:54:02 <Camail> for fear
23:54:11 <skram> true
23:54:29 <Camail> pick your dictator, and its the same thing
23:55:14 <Camail> stalin, mao, winnie the pooh, hitler,chavez, castro all the dummies follow the same bread crumbs to their doom
