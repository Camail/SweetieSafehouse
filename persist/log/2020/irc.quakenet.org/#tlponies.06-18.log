15:26:08 <Camail> you're welcome
15:26:28 <DuB`> d-length lul
15:26:45 <Camail> so is youtube stream monetization as shit as their normal monetization
15:27:15 <Camail> hats off to anyone willing to try to make content for this site anymore
15:30:19 <skram> I think most asian vtubers stream to other platforms too? like bilibili or whatever
15:30:27 <skram> no idea what the monetization is like there though
15:35:00 <skram> https://i.imgur.com/jpyynvh.jpg
15:35:51 <reification> there was a spate of vtubers losing monetisation because youtube would think ppl's clip of them was the original content...
