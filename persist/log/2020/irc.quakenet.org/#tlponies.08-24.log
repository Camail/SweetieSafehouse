10:42:40 <skrm> good
10:48:34 <Dot`> and where are you?
10:59:11 <Dot`> hes gone rawr
10:59:35 <Rawr|Fone> D:
11:00:37 <Rawr|Fone> Very rude
11:15:05 <skrm> im right here, pal
11:15:25 <Dot`> we can stop panicing rawr
11:15:30 <skrm> doing a labor
11:15:49 <Dot`> i just found out i need to be up at 5am again tomorow
11:16:04 <skrm> fuck
11:16:53 <Dot`> but i have a book this time to read for the bus at least
11:17:08 <Dot`> get around finaly to reading Roadside Picnic
11:18:35 <skrm> is that the stalker book
11:19:23 <Dot`> yea, ive had it sitting around for ages
11:23:43 <skrm> is it any good?
11:25:03 <reification> wouldn't he need to have read it to say?
11:26:41 <Dot`> its pretty short, about 200 pages, so will be able to get back to you pretty soon
11:29:13 <skrm> well he said he was reading it reif and its quite normal to have an opinion even if you've not finished it
11:29:35 <skrm> you could even judge it by its cover
11:30:09 <reification> :O
11:30:45 <Dot`> Have yet to start it, but by cover it looks good, but im biased
11:31:47 <skrm> have you ever read a great book with a terrible cover
11:31:50 <skrm> i cant recall doing that
11:32:59 <reification> i think the saying comes from an era when publishers tended to put lurid and unrelated covers on books
11:33:59 <reification> for a few books i have gone out of my way to buy the hardback version to get the great cover rather than the awful paperback one
11:34:47 <reification> actually the book i recommended before, The Chrysalids, comes in that category
11:35:51 <skrm> I tend to go for hardcovers but they're very cumbersome to read in bed
11:35:52 <reification> this is the correct version fyi: https://pictures.abebooks.com/CERTOBOOKS/685469503.jpg
11:37:07 <reification> audiobooks are best for bed
11:44:21 <Dot`> depends on the book if i get hardcover or not. looking at my bookshelf i have no idea how i make that decision, i have a mix
11:59:53 <skrm> i cant do audiobooks in bed
11:59:58 <skrm> it makes me fall sleep instantly
12:00:04 <Dot`> the dream!

15:17:17 <DuB`> So many decisions to make
15:18:43 <Dot`> nice, fun stuff
15:18:56 <Dot`> trying to figure out where it makes sense for a city to have formed
15:19:47 <DuB`> ya ya
15:21:38 <DuB`> And deciding between "different kingdom every 20 miles like old central europe" or larger nations :P
15:22:05 <Dot`> or a greek style of city states
15:22:37 <DuB`> ye
15:22:40 <DuB`> All of the above!

15:45:21 <DuB`> Ye
15:45:34 <DuB`> Very straighforward
15:45:43 <BioPhone> I might look into it, I've been meaning to do something like that too
15:45:54 <BioPhone> Do it do hexes tho
15:46:06 <DuB`> Can overlay hex grid
15:46:13 <BioPhone> Baws
15:47:58 <DuB`> I actually made it first in Inkarnate, but realized that the max detail level there wasn't what I wanted https://i.imgur.com/t9AsPZT.png
15:48:11 <DuB`> But that's even easier to use
15:48:39 <DuB`> And is free or $5 per month for extras
15:55:13 <Runbunny> This is awfully weird. 
15:55:19 <Runbunny> I think I was just hired.
15:55:51 <Runbunny> Need to show up at a place tomorrow, but I don't know where.
