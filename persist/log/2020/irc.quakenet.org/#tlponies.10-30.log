12:57:09 <Dot`> Hey ZK!
12:57:13 <Dot`> you back in canada yet?
12:57:15 <BioSC> thanks man
12:57:19 <BioSC> was a trip
13:00:55 <ZK> hi dot! yup back in canada
13:01:06 <ZK> must have been great, st louis has always been awesome team
13:01:14 <ZK> now no more captain :(
13:01:33 <BioSC> such is life
13:01:38 <BioSC> we shall make a new one
13:01:55 <BioSC> penalties of winning a cup, people want more moni
13:03:15 <BioSC> https://bleedinblue.com/2020/10/23/st-louis-blues-blame-doomsday-scenario/
13:03:19 <BioSC> this is a good article
13:04:35 <ZK> world ending is only true answer
13:04:42 <ZK> at least habs got allen out of it :D
13:06:37 <BioSC> yeah, we had too many goalie
13:06:52 <BioSC> his replacement rookie looks neat, maybe good
13:08:57 <ZK> just need binnington to be good too
13:09:24 <BioSC> yeah, i think he was maybe one of the guys who got the virus before playoffs started
13:09:32 <BioSC> we as a whole didn't look great
13:09:49 <BioSC> which is frustrating because before the shutdown we were doing fantastic
13:14:59 <ZK> ye, i hope you guys do great in regular season, whenever that starts. Krug should keep your PP going strong, and maybe faulk will step up some more
13:15:16 <BioSC> I want to like Faulk, I do
13:15:36 <BioSC> rumor is that they are aiming for jan1
13:15:51 <BioSC> wonder if thats a short season or are they gonna play till october again
13:16:15 <ZK> apparently they want everything to be done by july 1st cause olympics
13:16:36 <ZK> so probably shortened with super condensed schedule to have it be 60 games
13:16:50 <ZK> wonder if canadian division will be a thing
13:31:41 <BioSC> could be
13:31:52 <BioSC> i'm dreading the expansion
13:31:54 <BioSC> draft
13:36:47 <ZK> ooh right, i kinda forgot about it, i dont think we'll lose too too much

13:46:30 <reification> well portsmouth fc are the longest holders of the fa cup thanks to the interruption of ww2, so maybe your team can copy the trick bio :p
13:57:11 <ZK> unfortunately, a team just won the cup a month ago, bio's team was the year prior
14:22:56 <Dot`> Golly, i realised today why you got so many junk items in TQ. every creature is using the items it drops, meaning every item a creature has on it drops. you have to filter. Alt i think it was
14:23:04 <Dot`> you will find the same in Gim Dawn
14:24:02 <Golly> ah okay thanks
14:29:46 <Golly> havent played it yet, but its helpful to know for later
14:31:52 <Dot`> "To the left of the health bar is a button where you can cycle the loot filter to display all items, Magic & better, Rare & better, only show Epics/Legendaries. "
14:42:47 <BioSC> i dun wanna werk
14:43:07 <BioSC> someone cancel werk pls
14:44:38 <Dot`> i did a find and replace on 3 excel worksheets then took lunch
14:44:43 <Dot`> veru lazy day
14:48:27 <Rawr|Fone> I can write a letter to your boss bio

14:50:44 <Dot`> Sillyswede*
14:57:02 <BioSC> thanks rawr
14:57:15 <BioSC> and man, i used to do lots of that dot
14:57:23 <BioSC> then we got an actual engineering program lol
15:01:42 <Dot`> lol, i wrote the progrom, but i didnt have the PLC ID at the time, so just had to update the tags ready for import, easier to just find/replace 
15:02:05 <Dot`> then regenerate a few thousand tags
15:02:20 <Dot`> than*
15:02:44 <skrm> Excel is the best software ever made
15:02:48 <skrm> fight me
15:03:13 <Dot`> i dont disagree but we can still fight if thats what you want
15:03:15 <BioSC> with excel as ur defense, it wouldn't be a problem
15:03:25 <BioSC> ecks dee
15:03:35 <skrm> oh
15:03:43 <skrm> well i'd rather not fight Dot`
15:04:03 <BioSC> I took down top men yesterday, im jonesing
15:04:14 <skrm> i think he fights like a honey badger

15:16:11 <Dot`> Hey cane <3
15:17:23 <Cane> Hey hey. <3
15:24:43 <BioSC> yo
15:35:22 <Dot`> cane you got your friday pizza readY?
15:41:01 <Cane> How'd you know?
15:41:17 <Cane> https://www.twitch.tv/esl_dota2 is on today (starting soon[tm]) so I wanted some noms.
15:49:52 <Dot`> whos playing today?
15:53:45 <Cane> I think we START with Liquid vs Secret.
15:53:51 <Cane> So, worth tuning in.
15:54:36 <Dot`> Liquid!
15:54:41 <Cane> It's been a hell of a bracket.
15:55:07 <Cane> Team "mudgolems" has beaten everyone. They beat Liquid 2-1, Secret 2-0 (!), and are about to face off against Na'Vi in the upper bracket.
15:55:26 <Cane> Na'Vi beat OG and Vikin.gg to remain in upper.
15:55:42 <Cane> Liquid then knocked out Nigma the other day, and then they killed Vikin.gg to face off against Secret.
15:56:46 <Cane> Liquid is the ONLY TEAM who's had some success against Secret lately, so this should be a great game.
15:57:33 <Cane> But I think everyone's eyes are on mudgolems right now. Beating Nigma and Secret back to back (even 2-0ing Secret) after Secret has been literally unbeatable for months...
15:57:45 <Cane> And they just formed this September.
15:57:57 <Cane> 33 and Fata are the only names on the team I actually know.
15:58:01 <Dot`> is mudgolem a new collection of well known players? or really just come out of nowhere
15:58:02 <Dot`> ah
15:58:18 <Cane> skiter, BoraNija, 33, MiLAN, Fata.
15:58:38 <Cane> I know I'm newish to dota, but who the fuck are these people? I only know about 33 and Fata because they were on Alliance previously or something.
15:59:33 <Rawr|Fone> I remember milan
15:59:49 <Cane> I'm looking them up. I don't even know any of the prior teams they've been on.
15:59:54 <Dot`> yeam im too spotty in my dota watching to know 
15:59:56 <Cane> skiter was on Team Spirit for a while and that's it.
16:00:17 <Cane> Oh, MiLAN was on J.Storm for like 3 months lol
16:01:10 <Cane> So I guess all these never-quites put together a team on a whim, got 1st in the closed qualifier to ESL One Germany, and are currently murdering their way through the bracket.
16:01:47 <Golly> honestly i think its sad how little movement there is between tier2-1, at least in terms of teams
16:01:58 <Cane> Liquid vs Secret starting in a minute.
16:02:03 <Cane> https://www.twitch.tv/esl_dota2
16:02:04 <Golly> dota being super top heavy, and valve being valve
16:03:57 <Cane> I do agree, but it's kind of our fault for not watching other Dota.
16:04:24 <Cane> Though it's also harder to pay attention to because of the overall lack of attention.
16:05:28 <Golly> i feel like a league system where they got paid to play might work
16:05:37 <Golly> even with lowish viewership
16:06:38 <Golly> since the big tournaments tend to attract the tier 1s
16:07:51 <Golly> also i dont know why valve took away the ability for 3rd party tournaments to sell items etc
16:08:03 <Golly> ingame that is
16:13:45 <Cane> Draft phase going.
16:13:48 <Cane> I hate this layout.
16:14:33 <Golly> its very yellow
16:14:51 <Cane> It's very hard to see.
16:15:29 <Cane> Well, WePlay is definitely on top of the world when it comes to production values right now.
16:15:45 <Cane> So I guess I got used to it.
16:18:30 <Golly> they gave you like 2 sec to see the bans
16:18:35 <Golly> very generous of them
16:20:16 <Cane> Get cheesed.
16:21:01 <Golly> some yeet potential on both sides
16:22:13 <BioSC> "Look at this car nerds!"
16:22:14 <BioSC> lol
16:22:26 <BioSC> what a prop
16:22:49 <Cane> Hahah right?
16:23:05 <Cane> Mercedes being an esports sponsor is great.
16:23:37 <Cane> LOL ZAI
16:23:41 <BioSC> >feeding
16:23:42 <Cane> I hope the memes was worth it.
16:23:45 <BioSC> >in current year
16:24:20 <BioSC> question, where is the spine of a tree
16:24:21 <Dot`> well that was a start
16:25:13 <BioSC> didn't kill cute spider good choice
16:27:04 <Cane> Tiny always surprises me with his STUPID amounts of early game damage.
16:34:21 <BioSC> tree hurt to be thwacked with
16:42:00 <skrm> PL save us
16:43:22 <skrm> 2020 dota is weird, theres not even any russians on team secret
16:45:32 <Golly> was there ever any? :p
16:48:43 <Cane> While Taiga has Enigma, I don't count Liquid out.
16:48:57 <Cane> They do need to shut down Rubick though.
16:49:09 <skrm> maybe in 2011 golly :p
16:49:48 <Golly> the olden times, there were no secrets then
16:49:50 <Golly> only navis
16:50:10 <Cane> RIP Taiga.
16:50:39 <Cane> Holy shit, nice fight.

17:08:58 <Cane> Yep.
17:09:42 <Cane> And then afterwards we get mudgolems vs Na'Vi.
17:14:57 <BioSC> thats not a fair team tho, if you beat them, they split into two teams!
17:17:07 <skrm> good point
17:58:17 <Cane> Taiga is a very good Norwegian.
18:00:47 <Cane> Liquid is making me happy. <3
