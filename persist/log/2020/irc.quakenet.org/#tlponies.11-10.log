00:00:05 <Camail> i always put that trinket on for hades
00:00:18 <Camail> cuz getting hit 4 times in a second is lame
00:00:27 <Camail> and when that fight goes bad, it goes bad quick
00:00:39 <skram> yep
00:00:48 <skram> is athena dash the one that reflects?
00:00:52 <Camail> yea
00:00:59 <Camail> and while you deflect you cant take damage
00:01:03 <skram> i've only seen it once
00:01:05 <Camail> so its a massive iframe boost
00:01:17 <Camail> i usually force it with her trinket early on
00:01:19 <skram> and i've done a fair few runs at this point
00:01:31 <Camail> its pretty common unless youa re taking other dash boons early
00:01:32 <skram> ah
00:01:42 <Camail> boon replacement is rare
00:02:24 <skram> yeah i've only been using the dog trinket
00:02:29 <skram> because hp woo
00:03:24 <Camail> its nice before you get the mirror health buff, yea
00:04:55 <Dot`> cam, you see the third character was added to griftlands
00:05:02 <Camail> oh cool
00:05:08 <Camail> i'll check that out
00:07:04 <Dot`> cam,  wonder if calebs book has been illustrated yet?
00:07:34 <Camail> the storybook? maybe in time
00:07:58 <Dot`> i just expected it done with the amount of fan art generated
00:07:59 <Camail> that is his and tal's forte, so something's gonna come from it
00:08:13 <Camail> not enough night clubs
00:08:21 <Dot`> oh, i didnt mean officialy
00:08:28 <Dot`> but yea, i guess that will happen too
00:53:31 <reification> neat dotties, i enjoyed the first two
00:53:34 <reification> night all

18:19:47 <Runbunny> It was workful.
18:20:05 <Runbunny> I made some mistakes, but it's all right (I hope).
18:20:26 <Runbunny> I did take tomorrow and thursday off, as I am working all weekend.
18:22:35 <skrm> dot
18:22:38 <skrm> what sort of mistake runbun
18:22:50 <skrm> did you accidentally put corona in the drinking water
18:25:26 <Rawr|Fone> DoT DoT DoT
18:25:30 <Rawr|Fone> ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
18:25:40 <Runbunny> Nah, I made a shitty experiment and had some of the corona go through unnecessary purification.
18:25:58 <Rawr|Fone> Irc doesn't give me any notifications anymore
18:26:15 <Dot`> oh dear rawr

18:38:02 <skrm> you put some coronas through a coffee filter
18:38:03 <skrm> gotcha
18:53:50 <Runbunny> Easy for me.

19:18:18 <Dot`> runbun, skram, reif
19:40:23 <skrm> this seems perfectly legible tho??
19:43:21 <Dot`> you read moon runes?
19:43:47 <Dot`> also apprently it is true though, there was a reply in the comments to the wiki entry about it
19:59:39 <skrm> i cant read anime but its probably about bunnies
20:00:55 <Dot`> its a mixture of the introduction of mechanical pencils, making really thin lines, making all the lines really rounded and adding pictures throughtout with no order
20:23:31 <reification> by japanese standards that looks fine dotties
