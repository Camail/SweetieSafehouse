00:15:59 <Camail> DuB`  if you were considering making an LS build, the fire sword doesn't actually use the fire
00:16:31 <DuB`> Ya
00:26:36 <DuB`> Tried it and couldn't figure out what I was doing very well :P
00:26:44 <DuB`> Charge blade seems really cool though
00:32:36 <Camail> oh, so LS is all about getting levels
00:32:52 <Camail> your meter fills up, you do your right trigger combo, you level up
00:33:00 <Camail> get to level 3 and you have a ton of damage
00:33:31 <Camail> the ultimate dps pay out is the lunge at lvl 3, you jump up and do the omnislash
00:33:51 <Camail> you get a free level if you successfully counter a monsters move
00:36:48 <Camail> there are only 3 combos that do anything
00:37:39 <Camail> the rt combo is only to level, the heavy combo is to gain meter quickly, the light heavy light heavy combo is a bunch of quick hits designed to let you quickly react with a counter
00:37:55 <Camail> because you can only counter in the middle of a string, can't do it as the first move

10:00:19 <Dot`> makes me wonder if it was stolen at some point and replaced with that
10:14:22 <reification> i would put that as the most likely explanation
10:15:15 <skrm> the obvious answer is that they never went to the moon at all
10:16:00 <reification> nah the obvious answer is there used to be trees on the moon and it's real :p
10:16:10 <Dot`> the moon is a nature reserve skrm and therefore all you can take away from it is your trash

20:49:24 <Dot`> Friend
20:50:02 <skram> are you workin tomorro
20:50:24 <Dot`> its a monday
20:50:27 <Dot`> so yes
20:54:37 <skram> life is hard
20:54:47 <Dot`> life is suffering
20:55:24 <skram> have some solace https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WWdzDr4f0Q
20:55:40 <skram> ironically named swedish boy ft. confused guy with french horn
20:55:46 <Camail> skram so hardcore is stressful
20:55:59 <Camail> uber trials are very stressful
20:56:37 <skram> Ive played a lot of d3 hardcore in grifts
20:56:44 <skram> never ever would i go to labs with a hardcore char
20:57:11 <Camail> you would die irl then die in game
20:57:29 <skram> if i'd see a single spike trap on my hardcore boi i would log out and never return
20:57:37 <Camail> my goal is level 80
20:57:46 <Camail> then it's just gravy
20:57:58 <Camail> its really hard to get chaos res in this league...
20:58:20 <skram> well you have a billion dollars on your big main boi so you can get some big dick gear
20:58:22 <skram> still tho
20:58:42 <Camail> this isn't the same league
20:58:42 <skram> or is stash not shared between hardcore and softcore
20:58:45 <Camail> its a private league
20:58:45 <Dot`> cam you madlad
20:58:50 <skram> right right
20:58:57 <Camail> scion only, no magic or rare item drops
20:59:01 <Camail> so no veiled items
20:59:10 <Camail> so its really hard to get crafts
20:59:28 <skram> there's easier ways to have heartattacks probably
20:59:32 <Camail> i'm skipping all alva and legion
21:00:01 <Camail> my dude has 4.6k hp and runs enfeeble, and i'm still doing t4 maps
21:00:11 <Camail> so i don't really fear dying most of the times
21:00:35 <Camail> want to get to at least 6k hp before i transition parts of my build
21:00:49 <Camail> until then i'm playing like a bitch
21:03:36 <skram> is hardcore a popular mode at all in poe
