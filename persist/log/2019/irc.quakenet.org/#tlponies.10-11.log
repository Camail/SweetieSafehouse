02:07:33 <Camail> oof this particular boss i'm fighting is incredibly hard but the first interesting boss in the game
02:07:38 <Camail> so i am mad and happy at the same time
02:07:50 <Camail> i'm pretty sure it's a midboss, too
02:24:41 <Crisium> ur a midboss
02:33:25 <Camail> that'd be cool

02:41:15 <DuB`> What game, Camail?
02:41:23 <Camail> code vain
02:41:27 <DuB`> ooo
02:41:42 <Camail> basically he has a built in berserk phase where you're goal is to not die for 30 seconds
02:41:59 <Camail> it breaks the pattern of phase 1,2,dead
02:42:10 <Camail> it goes phase 1,2,1,2,dead
02:42:28 <Camail> this game is a blatant souls rip off with some really cool concepts added on
02:42:48 <Camail> lots of things that are souls fingerprints, but the way classes work is pretty nice
02:43:47 <DuB`> Sounds gewd
02:44:07 <DuB`> I have a whole page and a half of TED investigations but so many are very difficult :P
02:44:16 <DuB`> 15-min 2 man, 1 death, etc
02:45:24 <Camail> yup
02:45:43 <Camail> do temperds to get gear so that you can do AT even quests
02:45:48 <Camail> and that's the rest of the game
02:45:52 <Camail> event*
02:46:09 <Camail> i think 3-4 ATs have been ported to pc since i quit
02:53:04 <Camail> oof, finally done. that took awhile
02:53:30 <DuB`> noice

23:11:28 <DuB`> Well besides the dusty Burial-likes, my other favorite style is stuff like the two I linked you as "low slow floaty" on discord a while ago
23:11:53 <DuB`> And nothing else really comes close to those two styles
23:12:01 <skram> i liked those more
