16:58:41 <Dot`> ive been roped into playing some Space Engineers
16:58:47 <Dot`> you zounds? how was the rave?
17:00:17 <Zounds> eh it was alright
17:00:26 <Zounds> a lot of arseholes but that was to be expected
17:00:34 <Zounds> I did get to work with the police sniffer doggos though so that was good fun
17:00:49 <Dot`> did you get to pet a police dog?
17:01:00 <Crisium> Zounds partied hardy at a rave with police dogs?
17:01:16 <Zounds> I did get to pet them but only the ones who were on break
17:01:27 <Dot`> amazing
17:01:28 <Zounds> I was working at the rave cris
17:02:03 <Zounds> they were 3 springer spaniels and got rotated every 30mins
17:03:02 <Dot`> sounds like a fair size event to get all that police stuff
17:03:17 <Dot`> tohugh maybe thats normal, ive never been to a rave
17:03:22 <Zounds> Not really it was ~3k people I think
17:03:26 <Zounds> so not small but not massive either
17:06:19 <Zounds> I'm no expert on raves but I've been to a few
17:06:40 <Zounds> always working though you wouldn't catch me dead in there if I wasn't being paid for it
17:07:52 <Zounds> I'm too delicate to enjoy shitey trance/hardstyle and half naked slags beating up their boyfriends
