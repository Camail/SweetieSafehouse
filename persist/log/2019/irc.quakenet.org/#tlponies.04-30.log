21:35:57 <Crisium> ho
21:39:08 <Zounds> Runbunny: the forehead gems are for native garleans
21:39:33 <Zounds> native garleans are kinda like midlanders but a bit taller and stronger like cid
21:39:34 <reification> pretty tired micen, had to get up early to be taxi service
21:40:07 <Zounds> dunesfolk lalafel also have a similar forehead gem thing but it's more optional
21:42:20 <Zounds> The garleans are an empire so although they're all collectively garleans there are proper garleans
21:43:11 <Zounds> Cid and Nero are native garlean, biggs and wedge are "garleans" but presumably from lands owned by the garlean empire
21:54:40 <Zounds> a lot of the chaff and grunts you fight are just conscripts looking for citzenship or forced to fight
