20:04:25 <Bio> my ferret got really sick last night, just fyi. he had super low blood sugar and the emergency vet thinks he may have a tumor that secretes insulin
20:04:25 <Dot`> Honk
20:04:37 <Dot`> :(
20:04:52 <Dot`> hope its not that serious bio and he gets better
20:04:52 <Bio> vet can't see him till monday but hes got some drugs
20:05:23 <Bio> if its the kind of tumor they say it is it doesn't really get better
20:05:35 <Bio> hes well into his 6th year
20:05:45 <Bio> they don't live much longer than that
20:05:55 <Bio> the surgery doesn't fix it, it just makes it go away for a while
20:06:21 <Phearlock> Aw
20:06:29 <Bio> it kinda sorta fuckin sucks my guys
20:08:28 <Phearlock> It really does
20:08:43 <Phearlock> Cute furry friends need to live longer
20:10:05 <Bio> no fuckin kidding
20:10:32 <Bio> he's eating drinking and pooping still, so thats good
20:10:38 <Bio> he's just super tired
20:11:15 <Bio> the internet says that the tumor itself doesn't cause pain, just produces insulin which sucks the sugar out of you
