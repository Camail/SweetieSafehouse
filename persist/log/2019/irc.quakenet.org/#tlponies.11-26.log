00:29:07 <Camail> they always say that

02:55:42 <Bio> hej
03:02:41 <skrm> bio old pal
03:02:44 <skrm> overtime today?
03:02:59 <Bio> nah
03:03:04 <Bio> hanging out with my work bros
03:03:16 <skrm> cool
03:03:25 <skrm> what about salty meme fork lift guy
03:03:54 <Bio> nah not him
03:04:02 <Bio> mostly my slightly younger meme lords
03:04:38 <skrm> are you the senpai now bio
03:05:16 <Bio> mayhaps
03:05:24 <Bio> no ones called me senpai tho
03:05:38 <Bio> also skrm i finished Persona 5
03:05:42 <Bio> 110 hours
03:05:44 <Bio> asdf
03:06:12 <Bio> it made me realize i made the correct decision to not become a hardcore strimmer
03:06:30 <Bio> cause I like playing game alone for the most part
03:08:12 <skrm> fair enough
03:08:26 <skrm> do you need to have played the other personas to understand anything in p5
03:08:49 <Bio> as someone who didn't play any of the others
03:08:52 <Bio> not at all
03:10:03 <Bio> i've heard rumors that the velvet room, the jail with the guy with the huge nose, may be a recurring thing
03:10:10 <Bio> but other than that it wasn't a huge deal
03:13:18 <Camail> he was in p4
03:13:34 <Camail> of course, with a different VA, because plot
03:13:50 <Bio> indeed.
03:13:57 <Camail> lots of returning players were bummed by the new voice, then vindicated in the end
03:14:09 <Bio> yeh
03:14:43 <Bio> maybe that part woulda hit me harder if i had played 4 before
03:14:52 <Bio> but the story was moving fast at that point
03:15:52 <Bio> as a fan of jrpgs, i loved it
03:16:02 <Bio> if you don't like jrpgs, you may not like it
03:16:12 <Bio> but the asthetic is fuckin lit
03:16:22 <Bio> which may sustain you up to a point
03:16:34 <skrm> dont think ive really played any jrpgs
03:16:35 <Bio> but it is legit 100+ hours on first playthrough
03:17:13 <Bio> no final fantasies or nothin?
03:19:04 <skrm> not really?
03:19:41 <Bio> i see
03:19:54 <Bio> its basically a bunch of turn-based combat
03:20:08 <Bio> mixed with what is essentially slice of life anime
03:20:31 <Bio> but what I like about it is that everything is so stylish, and I never got tired of it
03:20:42 <Bio> you saw it when i was streaming
03:20:53 <Bio> i never got tired of doing all out attacks
03:21:02 <Bio> and i did them almost every battle if i could
03:21:15 <Bio> music is awesome, ect
03:21:30 <Bio> i cared about my teammates and other chars.
03:21:40 <skrm> ya thats why im kinda curious bout it
03:22:16 <Bio> if you already have a playstation, its a no brainer, it was like 20 dollarydoos
03:22:51 <Bio> if not, like i said i got 100 hours out of it, and that ends up being like 3bux/hr of entertainment for the whole setup
03:24:16 <skrm> i dont but i can borrow my brothers
03:25:53 <Bio> well certainly 20 bux to try it out wouldn't be a bad plan
03:28:30 <Bio> alternatively, persona 5 royal is coming out sometime next year, and i'm not too sure what it is, other than a different gaem with the same chars? may be an expanded game with more/different story? 
03:28:37 <Bio> could wait for that
03:28:44 <Bio> but thats probably full price game
03:30:03 <Bio> it says enhanced port

19:15:55 <Camail> skram yea like almost a month ago
19:16:48 <Camail> getting rank 34 in a large private league was good enough
19:17:01 <Camail> was hoping to do shaper but it was fine
19:19:51 <Runbunny> Gonna play in a private league next league as well. So I can only trade with me pals.
19:22:03 <Runbunny> Dot`, ?
19:22:33 <Dot`> runbun
19:22:42 <Camail> league start i always wanna play trade
19:23:06 <Camail> but runbun group found always turns into ssf
19:23:16 <Runbunny> Dot make sure this finds it's way to Dub https://i.redd.it/cw0lnwdj91141.jpg
19:23:26 <Camail> tho i guess you dont really go hard so it's someone else's problem
19:23:38 <Dot`> will do bun
19:23:44 <Camail> runbun we have a whole system for that kind of thing
19:23:47 <Runbunny> That's all right Camail. My flatmate usually play ssf, but he wants to play group found.
19:24:15 <Runbunny> But this way, I make sure that Dot looks at it as well.
