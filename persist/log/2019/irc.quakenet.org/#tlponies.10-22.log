22:02:25 <Phearlock> Pity about all the floors xD
22:04:36 <reification> i think you would be wise to be somewhat picky given what you are paying
22:04:39 <Dot`> skram,  find a empty space in the woods and claim it
22:04:44 <Dot`> then build a house
22:05:05 <skram> eh thought about it
22:05:41 <skram> but a new house is gonna cost me ~3mil
22:05:51 <reification> they tend to come and knock it down if you don't get planning permission
22:08:05 <skram> houses are hella expensive reif, if I want one thats even slightly urban (by norwegian standards) its gonna be twice what this house is listed at
22:09:04 <skram> like currently I live in a suburb to a city that has like 30k people living in it and houses round here go for that easy
22:09:21 <reification> if you lived in northern england you could get cheap housing
22:09:30 <reification> sadly there is a reason for that
22:09:46 <Dot`> out company is probably going to be doing work for ike homes
22:10:03 <Dot`> they make modulour houses
22:10:17 <skram> yeah
22:15:46 <skram> is where you live considered northern england, dot?
22:16:13 <Dot`> i think so? unless you go further north, then they will call me midlands probably
22:16:40 <Dot`> the more north you go the more north you have to be to count
22:17:18 <skram> so if you live in the shetlands you're a winner?
22:18:52 <Dot`> i tihnk scotland as a wole accepts anything south of thier border is weak and not north
22:19:24 <skram> i see
22:19:35 <Dot`> will need zounds to confirm
22:19:54 <skram> so if you live on hadrians wall you're the king in the north (of england) but to the scots you're just some southern barbarian
22:20:54 <Dot`> if you live on hadrians wall i belive your a squatter
22:21:28 <skram> even better
22:22:05 <skram> do squatters law count in heritage constructions
22:26:19 <Dot`> i dont think you can squat in/on an active building/site of any kind
22:26:50 <Dot`> and heritage is owned and maintained by various groups
22:27:15 <skram> ah too bad then
22:27:58 <Dot`> you cant some to england and claim a castle skram
22:28:03 <Dot`> also here you go https://imgur.com/gallery/gbxfwNz
22:28:11 <skram> i dont want a bloody castle
22:28:24 <skram> imagine the power bill on that
22:28:34 <skram> hahah
22:28:42 <skram> wooOOooOoOOw
22:29:06 <Dot`> wow
22:29:16 <Dot`> also, no power in castles, its all candles
22:29:43 <reification> here you go skram https://www.gov.uk/squatting-law/squatting-in-nonresidential-properties
22:29:52 <skram> ugh
22:30:03 <skram> fireplace is nice but at some point it just become another damn chore
22:30:31 <Runbunny> You have to be careful with fire Jonas.
22:30:32 <skram> what the heck is fly-tipping
22:30:35 <Runbunny> Lest you get burned.
22:31:04 <Dot`> wait reif
22:31:06 <skram> i am very experienced in all fire-related matters, runbun
22:31:07 <Dot`> "Simply being on another person’s non-residential property without their permission is not usually a crime"
22:31:18 <Dot`> so you can just walk into any industrial building?
22:31:23 <Dot`> even an active one
22:31:42 <reification> it does say usually
22:31:57 <skram> well it says person
22:32:02 <skram> so walking into a factory probably isnt good
22:32:37 <reification> if they have to stop the machines cause you walked in uninvited that may count as damage
22:33:17 <Dot`> but i could go to london and walk into any office
