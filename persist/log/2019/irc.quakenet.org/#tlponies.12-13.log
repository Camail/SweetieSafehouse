01:40:38 <Camail> Runbunny decide on a build yet?
01:40:50 <Runbunny> Nah.
01:41:22 <Runbunny> Maybe these game awards will help me.
01:52:57 <DuB`> Hm
01:53:06 <DuB`> I just had the worst burger I've had in a long time
01:53:14 <DuB`> But also maybe the best fries I've EVER had
01:55:12 <skrm> now you need to find the place with the best burger and the worst fries
01:55:14 <skrm> buy them both
01:55:28 <skrm> and combine them for the prime burger/fries meal
01:55:42 <DuB`> And one really awful meal
01:56:39 <skrm> make it a themed restaurant
01:57:16 <Bio> there was a new ff7 remake trailer
01:57:18 <Bio> looks neato
01:58:16 <Runbunny> But bio.
01:58:20 <Runbunny> It's Anime.
01:58:48 <Runbunny> 3.3.2020 release though.
02:00:42 <Bio> very anime
02:00:56 <Bio> its coming out very close to the persona 5 royal too
02:01:03 <Crisium> played it 20 years ago >:C
02:01:28 <Bio> same story, but it looks like its more actiony than turnbased
02:03:20 <Crisium> it's only like 1/3 of the story tho
02:03:40 <Runbunny> I haven't played ff7
02:03:44 <Runbunny> So I am good? :P
02:04:03 <Crisium> spoiler: cloud is insane
02:04:32 <Bio> p much
02:04:41 <Bio> is it really only a 3rd
02:04:44 <Bio> huh
02:04:46 <Crisium> midgar only
02:04:49 <Crisium> for the first remake
02:04:54 <Crisium> theres gonna be several
02:05:01 <Bio> oh ew
02:05:05 <Bio> ew 
02:05:06 <Crisium> they havent announced how many, but ppl think 3
02:05:09 <Bio> that feels bad
02:05:10 <Crisium> yeah its dumb
02:05:19 <Crisium> game wont actually be finished for like 6 more years
02:07:50 <Runbunny> lel
02:08:21 <Bio> I can wait then
02:08:35 <Bio> turns out i have the game on steam so i can play it again should i choose
02:08:59 <Bio> i actually don't care about any of these awards
02:09:07 <Bio> i just wanna see the new games and shit
02:10:25 <Runbunny> Yeah, give elden ring.
02:10:41 <Bio> god they milk the fug out of these
02:12:22 <Bio> the x tower
02:12:24 <Bio> lel
02:12:39 <Runbunny> Hahaha
02:12:41 <Runbunny> Xbox 2
02:15:36 <Bio> the fuck is this
02:16:11 <Bio> pretty nice pixels
02:28:15 <Runbunny> Camail, bows are bait this league, what are your thoughts?
02:28:51 <Camail> i think the reworked skills are good
02:29:12 <Camail> barrage is being hated on because of the multiplier
02:29:24 <Camail> but thats just because the potential is so strong
02:29:49 <Camail> ballistas are a trap, tho
02:30:13 <Camail> mines > ballistas
02:30:59 <Runbunny> Hmm.
