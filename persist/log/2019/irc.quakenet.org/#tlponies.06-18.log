03:18:29 <Cane> Hiya folks. <3
03:18:47 <Cane> Camail, really? Bladestorm has been bugged and people didn't notice?
03:18:56 <Camail> apparently!
03:18:58 <Cane> Have they fixed things like Flicker Strike taking two frenzy charges instead of one?
03:19:11 <Camail> oh also i put an interesting amulet in guild stash
03:19:26 <Camail> they haven't put out the patch yet, it's gonna be on thursday
03:23:47 <Cane> Interesting amulet indeed, I've never seen that one.
03:32:51 <Cane> Added a really good unset ring to the stash.
03:32:58 <Cane> Well. Good, not really good.
03:33:03 <Cane> +1 sockets, small life+res.
