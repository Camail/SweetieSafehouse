09:55:32 <Runbunny> Biology-Biotechnology. 
09:55:41 <Runbunny> My thesis was about genome editing.
09:56:07 <DoT|Phone1> That's all very complex for a simple person such as i
09:56:59 <DoT|Phone1> did they ask where you got all the blood for testing?
10:02:40 <Runbunny> Nah I explained that it was from either patients or unsuspecting blood donors.
10:03:48 <DoT|Phone1> ' volunteers '
10:09:33 <Runbunny> Exactly.
10:09:45 <Runbunny> My hands are stained with blood.
10:09:51 <Runbunny> Freely given.
10:18:16 <DoT|Phone1> I assume it's like giving someone the Heimlich. if they can't respond it's taken as consent.

13:29:49 <skram> whoah
13:30:11 <skram> are you one of those salarymen dot
13:30:57 <DoT|Phone1> I don't know what that means Skram. but I do indeed get paid monthly for the work I do
13:32:11 <Golly> i think he called you japanese
13:32:46 <DoT|Phone1> Skram. real life isn't an anime
13:32:51 <DoT|Phone1> I'm sorry
13:32:55 <skram> as far as i can tell its people who work in offices, do meetings, and hate their job
13:33:05 <skram> im like 99% certain its a real thing
13:33:28 <Golly> you drink in the weekdays and sleep in strangers' laps on the subway
13:33:51 <skram> something like that
13:35:30 <DoT|Phone1> I do work in an office most of the time, there are occasional meetings to try find out what the client actually wants, but I enjoy the work. also I don't drink, I just cry in my empty apartment because I'm all alone.
13:35:44 <DoT|Phone1> So I tick about half those I guess
13:37:16 <skram> but do you sleep in strangers lap on the train
13:37:43 <DoT|Phone1> I walk to work in the rain
13:38:03 <Golly> i think that counts if you eat toast on the way
13:38:15 <skram> hmm
13:38:19 <skram> do you stay home on sunny days then
13:38:42 <DoT|Phone1> I live in England
13:39:25 <Golly> never heard of it
13:40:22 <DoT|Phone1> it's not famous like south Africa
13:40:43 <skram> its them who think they invented tea, golly
13:41:02 <Golly> i say
13:41:15 <Golly> jolly good that
13:42:13 <DoT|Phone1> all it took was getting a country addicted to opium
13:44:19 <Zounds> I don't think the claim was ever inventing tea was it?
13:44:25 <Zounds> It was drinking a lot of it and drinking it properly
13:44:57 <DoT|Phone1> I think English are very proud of how they as such a small place managed to plunder so much
13:46:18 <Zounds> England and Britain as a whole did punch well above its weight for a while
13:46:39 <Zounds> Still does but it's mostly just sadness now
13:51:11 <skram> i thought the sun never set on the british empire
13:51:22 <DoT|Phone1> it still hasn't
13:51:47 <DoT|Phone1> Britain still holds a small island that allows that to continue
13:52:10 <DoT|Phone1> somewhere south America I think
13:52:46 <Golly> good old Gunboat diplomacy
13:52:48 <DoT|Phone1> near*
13:53:03 <Zounds> the pitcairn islands keep the dream alive skrammen
13:54:19 <DoT|Phone1> ah. never remember their name
13:56:12 <Zounds> Still got the falklands aswell
13:56:31 <Zounds> keeps the argies seething when they need something to direct their populace away from a scandal
