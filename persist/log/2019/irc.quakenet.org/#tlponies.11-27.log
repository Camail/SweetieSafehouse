08:00:25 <Dot|Phone> Bio likes octopath on switch
08:03:55 <Dot|Phone> I'm really not sure, thinking about it I don't pay attention to new games much as I'm not willing to pay £60 for a buggy mess
08:04:32 <Dot|Phone> So all rpgs I know are old
08:06:42 <Camail> skram  octopath traveler is supposedly quite good
08:06:48 <Camail> been meaning to play it 
08:07:05 <Camail> outer worlds is a solid addition to the fallout style of games
08:07:24 <Camail> it's not amazing, but it is pretty fun and scratches the rpg itch
08:08:06 <Camail> if you never played obsidian's Tyranny i'd recommend it, very fascinating
