00:03:22 <Cane> I wonder if I should do another summoner build. I quite liked the SRS build back then. It was quite active.
00:08:09 <Camail> the builds exist, they aren't very popular but that couldn't matter less
00:08:26 <Camail> i bet the melee rework helps
00:09:27 <Camail> necromancer wasn't hit wit the nerf bat like the other two
00:10:57 <Camail> also Dot` witch was fucked SUPER hard unless you play a curse build, non-curse/DoT occultist and elementalist were nerfed pretty hard
00:11:18 <Cane> lol did you ping Dot` when you tried to say Damage over Time?
00:12:08 <Camail> that was intentional
00:12:17 <Camail> he was saying he wanted to try witch
00:12:47 <Camail> but honestly he'll probably be going trickster because he really just wants to play a spellcaster
00:12:48 <Cane> One of my only complaints I had about PoE back then was that every build was just two buttons. I was used to Diablo II where some builds need you to swap between 5-6 skills, and my main build in Chaos league was literally holding down a button and moving my mouse around the screen.
00:12:50 <Cane> That was my best one.
00:13:26 <Camail> well, the linking mechanic means that you are always gonna have a really strong primary ability
00:13:38 <Cane> Yeah but I mean
00:13:45 <Cane> there was no positioning, you just instagibbed a whole screen while holding down a button.
00:14:24 <Runbunny> Later map bosses are not like that. Well I guess you could get a face tanking build going.
00:14:32 <Cane> Mm.
00:15:17 <Camail> also it depends on the build, if you do a build designed for crazy fast clear speeds your gonna get two things:
00:15:25 <Camail> off screen damage and insanely fast move speed
00:15:43 <Camail> but slower high damage melee builds are a thing
00:16:16 <Camail> it's just that it's a sandbox and the builds that get the most loot are gonna be the most popular, and that means high damage, really fast skills

00:17:56 <Runbunny> Anyhoo sleep.
00:19:26 <Cane> Yeah, I think I would have preferred my melee build but that one became ineffective even before I got to early maps tbh.
00:19:55 <Cane> I did land a Bisco's though, so that was neat.
00:25:20 <Bio> i did a double take on that line there cane
00:25:32 <Cane> Which one?
00:25:50 <Camail> bisco's
00:25:59 <Camail> bio's weird cousin
00:27:47 <Bio> we don't talk about him
00:28:54 <Cane> RIP, lost all my good names, didn't know they expire after a year.
00:28:58 <Cane> Oh well.
00:44:32 <Camail> have you played the game when it has had it's full act 10 story cane
00:44:54 <Camail> because according to steam i played 9 years ago and boy was it way different
00:45:06 <Camail> er, 6
00:45:32 <Cane> Yeah, Chaos league was when I played.
00:45:40 <Cane> That was just a year or so ago.
00:46:02 <Cane> I think it was Chaos.
00:46:09 <Camail> ah
00:46:27 <Cane> 3.1.0 
00:46:27 <Cane> December 8, 2017
00:46:33 <Cane> Makes sense.
00:47:08 <Cane> I remember starting an Essence Drain build and being horribly bored.
00:51:11 <Cane> I'm not sure what to do for this league tbh.
00:51:19 <Cane> I'll need to look up a bunch of builds.
00:54:22 <Cane> Camail, what will you be doing this league?
00:58:14 <Camail> ummm good question
00:58:33 <Camail> so i was going for chieftain tectonic slam because ele conversion is cool
00:58:44 <Camail> but once the skill gems came out and the build was shown i was like bleh
00:59:09 <Camail> because chf ts tree travels to the opposite side of the tree and it just looks ugly and not very cool
00:59:26 <Cane> Lots of wasted nodes?
00:59:29 <Camail> so i wanna go berserker because RAGE triple buff
00:59:46 <Camail> yea, the damage is really good but it's just like...feels like the build shouldn't exist
00:59:53 <Cane> lol
01:00:28 <Camail> so i want to do berserker but i dont want to do cyclone
01:00:37 <Camail> also TS is just another aoe skill, tbh
01:00:44 <Camail> it's not melee, and i wanted to try melee

08:31:20 <DoT|Phone1> you all ready?
08:32:16 <DoT|Phone1> also what's a good witch build I can steal
08:32:35 <Runbunny> For PoE, yes. For defense, not yet.
08:33:14 <DoT|Phone1> is your defence in 12 hours??
08:33:30 <DoT|Phone1> I thought you where talking about league start
08:33:48 <Runbunny> Elementalist was nerfed, but it's probably still alright. Other than that, summoner is probably still pretty good.
08:34:15 <Runbunny> Chaos builds are also pretty neat. essence drain + contagion.
08:34:25 <Runbunny> NAh defence is this tuesday.
08:36:01 <Runbunny> Dot I am going to do a occultist build with bane and or soulrend.
08:38:19 <DoT|Phone1> I was going to do a curse build but cam said they got nerfed heavily
08:50:57 <Runbunny> Nah, well it was more the defense of the occultist acendency that was nerfed.
08:51:18 <Runbunny> You could do a chaos dot build life build just fine.
08:51:29 <Runbunny> I can link you one if you want.

15:54:55 <Dot`> ah right, underground trains
15:55:06 <DuB`> I wouldn't drive a car in that city if you paid me to :P
15:55:25 <Dot`> thats not bad at all, i walk half an hour to work and about 45 minutes home
15:55:34 <Dot`> good to get out and stretch legs 
15:55:48 <Dot`> though i do wish there was less uphill on the way home :/
15:57:51 <DuB`> Walk portion will be between times square and grand central which is a pretty... exciting 2 blocks
16:04:37 <DuB`> Time for errands and stoody so I can play all the rest of the day

17:43:08 <Dot`> you all ready to go fast cam?
17:43:11 <Dot`> its soon right?
17:43:16 <Camail> yea a few hours
17:43:26 <Camail> downloading the patch right now
17:44:56 <Zounds> gl in PoE pons
17:47:17 <Camail> there's always room for more
17:48:07 <DuB`> o right I need a filter thing and build thing and thing thing and aaaa
17:49:27 <Camail> i linked you a build
17:49:46 <DuB`> Ya wobsite was down though
17:50:06 <Camail> it willb e until right before league start
17:50:20 <Camail> because its all on poe and their website is part of the game
17:50:42 <DuB`> ree
17:50:50 <Camail> http://www.filterblade.xyz/ filters here, use semi-strict
17:50:58 <Camail> dont change anything else
17:52:17 <DuB`> I still need to finish collecting 2 more sets for d3 completion!
17:52:18 <DuB`> aaaaaa
17:59:03 <Camail> you have more than 2 months to do that
17:59:25 <Camail> i'm happy i got the archon set in d3 but i don't think i'll be getting those wings
17:59:46 <Camail> i'd rather keep my diablo hype for d4
18:00:03 <Camail> i hope they retcon most of d3
18:00:09 <Camail> story-wise
18:05:45 <Camail> the website is back up
18:09:09 <Dot`> cane , you playing on release or tomorow?
18:09:25 <Dot`> or both i guess
18:11:55 <Zounds> d4?
18:11:59 <Zounds> is that a thing?
18:12:12 <Dot`> sorry, i was talking poe
18:12:27 <Zounds> oh I meant from what cam was saying
18:12:50 <Camail> it was "leaked"
18:12:57 <Zounds> So I see
18:13:12 <Camail> supposedly there was a sc game that was cancelled to pull resources onto ow2 and d4
18:13:22 <Camail> we'll learn if that's correct very soon
18:13:37 <Zounds> Yeah
18:13:55 <Zounds> Overwatch 2 is a bit surprising if true
18:14:36 <Camail> maybe they'll have a single player
18:14:42 <Camail> one can hope
18:14:55 <Camail> they know it will sell millions, tho
18:15:28 <Camail> and blizzard loves making an ip then getting 100 games out of it
18:15:29 <Zounds> Well I'll buy it
18:15:37 <Zounds> Blizzard has me by the balls
18:15:50 <Zounds> I didn't even like d3 and will probably buy d4 :(
18:16:05 <Camail> if it looks good i'll buy it
18:16:45 <Camail> d3 has grown as a game, and ARPGs have grown as a genre so hopefully it's better
18:17:32 <DuB`> Mmmm Real Word Auction House 2 hype
18:17:35 <DuB`> lol
18:19:08 <Camail> i would be quite sad
18:19:37 <Camail> skram have you updates poe
18:19:42 <Camail> its a 6gb patch

18:52:06 <Camail> Runbunny you going bane or ed/contagion
18:54:09 <Cane> Dot`, not sure, I don't even have a build yet.
18:54:26 <Cane> Ideas?
18:56:59 <Camail> blood and sand stances are cool
18:57:23 <Camail> i'm using https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2513974
18:57:33 <Camail> because the melee skill is swappable so you can try out a bunch of skills
18:57:58 <Cane> Oh cool. I dig builds like that.
18:58:30 <Camail> i'm gonna try the bladestorm variant
18:58:40 <Camail> partly because it's the main variant and partly because it looks cool
18:59:32 <skram> are we doing the same thing cam
18:59:48 <Camail> you are doing the cyclone variant
19:00:07 <Camail> they won't play the same
19:00:28 <Camail> but i wanted you to go fast and shred bitches
19:00:49 <Camail> and rage is a part of your identity so going slayer would be a disservice
19:01:20 <Camail> Dot`  did you find a build?
19:01:33 <skram> true
19:02:40 <Camail> i'd suggest doing a trickster build if you wanted to do spells, occulstist is still good for curses tho
19:02:49 <Camail> can't to an energy shield build tho
19:04:00 <Dot`> runbun linked me a build that was ES based, is he trying to get me killed?
19:04:40 <Camail> can you link it to me
19:05:08 <Cane> lol
19:05:11 <Cane> I never did an ES build.
19:05:27 <Cane> I think I'll see if some kind of summoner is reasonably viable.
19:05:35 <Cane> Forever chasing that D2 Necromancer feel.
19:06:04 <Camail> well ES is dead at league start, early nodes are dead
19:10:41 <Dot`> it was on my phone as i was at work
19:10:54 <Dot`> Runbunny, you have it or should i go looking on PoE site
19:11:08 <Cane> Sweet, looks like the Spectre summoner still rocks just fine.
19:11:40 <Cane> Good fallback if I can't find anything else.
19:14:13 <Camail> what was it called
19:14:24 <Cane> https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2255988
19:15:33 <Camail> neat, also Dot`  can you remember the ascendancy/skill combo from the title
19:15:41 <Camail> oh was somebody in discord
19:15:45 <Camail> i'm muted
19:16:06 <Dot`> i only had a breif look
19:16:14 <Dot`> i tihnk it was vortex
19:17:28 <Camail> ah, yea probably occultist cold DoT
19:18:19 <Dot`> these are the 2 he linked i tihnk, http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/1963181 , http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2514989
19:20:18 <Camail> ES occultists isn't really a thing, it lost all of it's survivability

19:21:47 <skram> eat pant
19:21:50 <Camail> if Q deems them unworthy, cast thme out
19:22:54 <Cane> Bahahaha I found a summoner build whose stated goal is getting as many ridiculous summons as possible. Tempted.
19:23:48 <Cane> It also generates frenzy charges for allies.
19:23:53 <Camail> here in summoner land we dont scale with %, we scale with BODIES
19:24:00 <Cane> I think I'm doing this.
19:24:09 <Camail> meme it up
19:24:32 <Cane> It literally gets every summon skill.
19:25:07 <Cane> Raise Spectre, Phantasm Support, Herald of Agony, Raise Zombie, Summon Skeleton, Summon Holy Relic... and Vaal Summon Ridiculous Amount Of Temporary Bullshit.
19:25:24 <Camail> i think i remember seeing that build
19:25:28 <Camail> like 72 summons or something
19:25:44 <Camail> hope you have a good heatsink
19:25:46 <DuB`> >_>
19:26:34 <Camail> dub for your early build you want orb of storms and storm brand
19:26:34 <Cane> I DO.
19:26:39 <Camail> lul
19:26:43 <Cane> I'm drooling.
19:26:44 <Cane> This is happening.
19:27:01 <Camail> well we can all start soon
19:27:49 <Camail> Cane  https://www.twitch.tv/mathil1
19:27:56 <Camail> poe streamers are weird
19:28:36 <Cane> I know.
19:30:24 <Cane> Has Path of Building updated yet?
19:30:44 <Camail> trees, yes
19:30:46 <Camail> gems no
19:31:29 <Cane> Mm.
19:32:03 <Camail> so melee dps doesn't look right, and a lot of melee support and auras dont exist yet
19:34:22 <Camail> Dot` skram DuB`  Runbunny  get into the queue!
19:34:36 <Dot`> what, we playing now?
19:34:38 <skram> yes father
19:34:43 <Dot`> i should look at builds then properly
19:34:46 <DuB`> Ack
19:34:48 <DuB`> Waaait
19:35:00 <Runbunny> I am in the queue.
19:36:01 <Dot`> only 37537 ppl in queue
19:37:05 <reification> barely a queue at all
19:37:10 <Cane> 39346 people ahead of me.
19:37:13 <Cane> Nbd.
19:37:38 <Dot`> curse happy vortex might just be the build becuase im lazy
19:38:00 <Cane> I probably need to set the game up properly tbh. I've barely booted it up.
19:38:16 <Cane> Oh right, item filter.
19:38:46 <Camail> yea that's fine dot
19:39:13 <Camail> DISCRAWD TIEM
19:39:27 <Camail> runbun is gonna be speeding ahead of us
19:39:40 <Dot`> oh thats the one with only shield
19:39:55 <Camail> you only go CI near end game
19:39:59 <Camail> you can follow the build
19:40:21 <Camail> but the build doesnt look updated
