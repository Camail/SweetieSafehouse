23:09:23 <Rawr|Fone> Crisioom
23:09:27 <Rawr|Fone> Pretty gooood
23:09:46 <Rawr|Fone> Going to try to fix my sleep schedule today
23:09:52 <Rawr|Fone> How are you
23:11:05 <Crisium> im happy cause i did good at my video game!
23:11:16 <Crisium> a healthy sleep schedule is a worthy goal
23:11:17 <Crisium> gl fren
23:11:42 <skram> whats a healthy sleep schedule pal
23:14:11 <Crisium> probably not what you have lol
23:14:19 <Crisium> i would say it is waking up within 2 hours of the same time every day
23:14:30 <Crisium> and if you can help it, waking up between 5am and 9am
23:14:30 <Crisium> imo
23:14:49 <Crisium> even tho waking up at 5am is horrible feeling, it is actually kinda natural
23:15:33 <skram> i see
23:15:46 <Crisium> skram tell me your weekly wake up times
23:16:14 <skram> uuh depends on what shifts im doing
23:16:58 <Rawr|Fone> I have been getting up later and later the last few weeks
23:17:06 <skram> but usually wake up at 6 if im starting at 7 or 1200-1400 if i start at 1500 or around 1700 if i start at 2300
23:17:45 <Crisium> ya see thats wrecking havoc on your body
23:17:49 <Crisium> not healthy at all
23:18:00 <skram> :(
23:18:02 <Crisium> but i know you have to
23:18:04 <Crisium> so it's ok
23:18:16 <Crisium> i mean if you're adaptable im sure its fine
23:18:23 <Crisium> but for most ppl they would be groggy
23:18:28 <Rawr|Fone> Probably not very good
23:18:35 <Crisium> as their circadian rhythm is thrown off
23:18:47 <skram> well i sleep fine most of the time
23:18:50 <Crisium> good
23:18:56 <skram> but hopefully im not doing this when im 40
