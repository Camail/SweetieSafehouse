17:51:13 <Zounds> somebody go in my place
17:51:50 <skraam> ill go np
17:51:55 <skraam> what are we doing there zounds
17:52:32 <Zounds> werk
17:53:00 <Zounds> there's a football match and they don't have the dudes they need to run it properly so me and some others are going up from glasgow
17:53:31 <skraam> ill bring my fightin' pants
17:55:43 <Zounds> you'll be in charge of the family stand it's real ez
17:55:55 <Zounds> unlikely to be any fighting
17:56:02 <skraam> still though
17:56:16 <skraam> gotta be ready in case one of those uppity brats look at you funny like
17:57:44 <Zounds> if you're wanting a fight then you could ask to manage the segregation line instead
17:58:05 <Zounds> It's Hearts that they're playing against and they're primo dickheads so you prob would get a chance to do something
17:58:22 <skraam> I thought we ended segregation in the 60s
17:59:09 <Zounds> I don't think UK ever had segregation
17:59:31 <Zounds> racial segregation at least
17:59:36 <Zounds> football matches have it
18:00:37 <skraam> i suppose it'd turn into the bloody thunderdome if you didnt
18:02:08 <Zounds> Maybe
18:03:12 <Zounds> For a lot of matchups maybe folks would behave better if there was some threat of repercussion from the guys they are insulting though
18:04:18 <skraam> for most of them probably
18:04:38 <Zounds> For the more bitter rivalries though they would relish being within swinging distance with one another

21:36:28 <Dot`> cute ferret
21:44:45 <Camail> i dont understand why people wash animals
21:44:51 <Camail> why would a sloth need to be clean
21:45:25 <Dot`> certain animals, like if you own a dog, and you live ina country it doesnt rain often, they smell bad
21:45:41 <Dot`> a sloth? no idea 
21:48:46 <Camail> yea that's more where i was going with it
21:49:15 <Camail> sometimes we clean domesticated animals because they smell, and it doesn't need to harm
21:53:26 <Camail> so projared's subreddit has revolted
21:53:57 <skram> whos projared
21:54:15 <Camail> youtube dude
21:54:24 <Dot`> the guy being revolted against skram
21:54:26 <Camail> i never watched his stuff specifically but i watched a ton of people around him
21:54:48 <Camail> even his mistress
21:55:18 <Camail> so it's weird unfollowing someone because they did a really shitty thing, i usually stop followng because i dont enjoy their content

22:01:28 <Dot`> you not played it at all?#
22:01:42 <Camail> i played like 10 minutes but didn't stick
22:02:09 <Camail> greek mythos didn't really stick with me
22:02:24 <Dot`> I owuld say its my favourite after D2 of that style ofo game
22:02:44 <Dot`> egypt is second act cam, spoilers
22:02:52 <Camail> in terms of ARPG its probably poe>d2>sacred>d3 for me
22:04:16 <Camail> I'd probably like it more now, i have a different mindset now
22:04:20 <Dot`> i never got into sacred, i think it was sacred 2
22:04:31 <Camail> all i require is the ability to completely remap skill/movement buttons
22:04:40 <Camail> if it doesnt have that i literally cant play it
22:05:25 <Camail> even then, my left thumb is kinda fucked up from using spacebar as movement in poe
