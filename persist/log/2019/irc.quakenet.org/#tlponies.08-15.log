16:04:54 <Cane> Published video. Instantly get a comment posted. lol
16:05:53 <skraam> damnit
16:05:58 <skraam> missed my chance to say first
16:07:16 <skraam> so did it take you just as long to finish the game as the videos or have you been editing the final episode for a while, cane?
16:08:22 <Cane> Just the videos take forever to make. It's a ton of work for barely a couple hundred views (a week's worth of free time per episode some times), and it's hard to convince yourself it's a worthwhile project.
16:08:33 <Cane> Mostly procrastination and lack of interest on my part.
16:08:37 <Cane> But at least it's done and I can say that conclusively.
16:08:39 <skraam> yeah i bet
16:08:53 <skraam> editing's pretty mint
16:10:01 <Cane> The series as a whole is my favorite thing I've ever made, and I really like the montage at the end of the final episode. Lot of memories for me.

21:26:59 <skram> gifts are untaxed, runbun
21:27:15 <DvB|fon> Especially if you don't tell taxman.
21:28:00 <Runbunny> There are taxes on gifts!
21:28:11 <Runbunny> Well if they're large enough.
21:28:39 <Runbunny> It's like 350 dollars for me to go to USA.

21:29:49 <Runbunny> He spent them all on fancy monitors and gfx cards.
21:29:54 <Runbunny> Never.
21:30:24 <Runbunny> Anyhoo sleep.
21:38:57 * skram slaps DoT` around a bit with a large trout
21:49:37 <DoT`> whhyyy
21:50:16 <skram> just wanted to see if you were asleep yet
21:51:58 <DoT`> no
21:52:01 <DoT`> i was gaming
21:52:05 <DoT`> i should be asleep though
21:52:22 <skram> hmm
21:52:29 <skram> did you finish your sat yet
21:53:07 <DoT`> it will take like a month at least skram
21:53:15 <DoT`> but im not there till next friday
21:53:31 <DoT`> another guy is handling it till then, then he goes on holiday
21:53:44 <Bio> FE soon
21:53:46 <skram> why so long
21:54:00 <DoT`> skram you have to test EVERYTHING
21:54:10 <DoT`> all IO, every alarm, every process, every fault
21:54:37 <DoT`> imagine turning every small thing on and off/ open close at your work
21:54:40 <skram> pfft
21:54:56 <skram> how big is this project
21:57:28 <DoT`> asp feed, anoxic zone, asp lanes, asp blowers, FST, desludge and RAS control, RAS/SAS pumps, Thickener feed tanks, TFT air mixers, Thickener feed pumps, Drum thickeners, sludge export, return liquors, washwater booster, washwater transfer, poly handling, poly mixing, service water
21:57:33 <DoT`> i think that was the zones
21:58:30 <DoT`> ASP lanes has 8 PID's!!!
21:59:17 <skram> auto tune, plz
21:59:39 <skram> what sort of controls are you using
22:00:02 <skram> PLCs with some sort of HMI attached or a integrated SCADA thing
22:00:50 <DoT`> a main SCADA and HMI at the MCC and 2 further HMI's at the drum thickneres
22:02:38 <skram> neat
22:03:01 <skram> distributed IO over ethernet? or are you using something dumb like profibus
22:04:03 <DoT`> what you have against profibus
22:04:13 <DoT`> and no, its just a copper network
22:04:51 <skram> dunno, profibus gives weird errors sometimes
22:05:02 <skram> what do you mean by copper network

22:08:13 <DoT`> ethernet
22:08:28 <skram> i see
22:08:34 <DoT`> i dont know, we call it either copper or fiber
22:09:43 <skram> p cool
22:09:49 <DoT`> skram, the fact is no one seems to know how to set profibus up correctly, they just click till it seems to be doing the right thing
22:09:57 <DoT`> its annoying
22:10:51 <skram> profibus is at least 30 years old by now, DoT`
22:11:45 <DoT`> oh... now i recall exactly what that is
22:12:02 <DoT`> we have recently been trying to do some asset replacment with it
22:12:18 <DoT`> one guy spent 3 days trying to get it to talk so he could copy the code off
22:12:45 <DoT`> rockwell likes its profibus
22:14:45 <DoT`> my knowledge of systems is still spotty skram as for the 9 months ive been working there, all but 3 weeks at the start have been on 1 job
22:15:11 <skram> well its a big job

22:16:23 <skram> AB uses mostly ethernet/ip or devicenet
22:17:03 <skram> or the rare rs485 but thats a bit old-fashioned
22:17:55 <DoT`> well the only time i have come in contact with AB is asset replacemtn jobs for sites that are 20+ years old
22:18:05 <DoT`> all new stuff we do is seimens
22:18:18 <skram> siemens is the devil
22:18:18 <skram> pls
22:19:10 <DoT`> better the devil you know?

22:19:40 <skram> I guess
22:20:02 <skram> not that I have much experience with anything else than S5
22:22:05 <skram> How my old boss managed to make that old miserable hag communicate with mondern PCs over ethernet/ip is probably one of the greatest victories of the 21st century
