00:14:09 <Camail_> haha, nice
00:14:11 <BioPhone> Asdf
00:14:17 <Camail> is he in maps?
00:14:42 <Camail> DuB` you do realize that your brother is officially the better person now that he plays the superior ARPG
00:14:51 <Camail> i'm sorry but he's gonna have to take your place here
00:15:23 <DuB`> What if I no longer play any arpg
00:15:30 <DuB`> And poe is the one I've played more recently D:
00:16:10 <DuB`> Also how rich are you so I can put him back down a bit

00:16:31 <Camail> well i have 31 ex on hand
00:16:34 <Camail> but like...

00:16:57 <Camail> i've only dropped like 5 of them
00:17:10 <DuB`> I dunno if 330 hours played is new...
00:17:53 <Camail> not as new as i thought, but still relatively new
00:18:15 <DuB`> He is still in acts
00:18:15 <Camail> thats like 2 leagues of dedicated playtime
00:18:22 <DuB`> Ya
00:18:24 <Camail> getting an exalt in acts is rare
00:18:41 <Camail> i think i've had that happen once at most? maybe not ever
