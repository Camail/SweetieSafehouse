07:20:33 <Cane> DoT|Phone, there are two overhaul mods I haven't tried. One (Pain of Misery) is in Russian and has a Google Translate version, and the other is Anomaly.
07:21:01 <Dot> lol, time to learn russian for the true STALKER experience
07:21:13 <Cane> Yeah that's where we are.
07:21:25 <Cane> I think I'll try Pain of Misery first.
07:21:33 <Cane> Might stream it if it's stable.
07:22:05 <Dot> gl!
07:22:38 <Cane> I'm looking forward to all the horribly translated item names.
07:31:10 <Cane> Doooot, I'm excited about new STALKER things I haven't tried.
07:31:12 <Cane> Make it download faster!
07:32:13 <Dot> its got to come all the way from Russia, its doing its best
07:33:02 <Cane> Don't come to me with problems, come to me with solutions.
07:33:43 <Dot> drink more vodka. you will then become closer to mother russia and therfore it wont have so far to travel
07:36:22 <Rawr|Fone> Genius dot
07:36:44 <Rawr|Fone> You must be an engineer
07:37:18 <Dot> Thanks rawr
07:37:30 <Dot> did that guy win the thing rawr?
07:38:56 <Rawr|Fone> The semi final is today at 6 pm
08:01:35 <Cane> ...
08:01:42 <Cane> I installed Pain of Misery.
08:01:51 <Cane> It created two shortcuts on my desktop.
08:01:53 <Cane> Pain of Misery
08:01:57 <Cane> and Pain of Misery (safe)
08:02:01 <Dot> lol
08:03:39 <Cane> I'm clicking on the implied unsafe version. I also like to live dangerously.
08:04:50 <Dot> mad lad
08:05:15 <Cane> Oh god it's all in weird letters help
08:05:30 <Cane> I know there's a way to turn it to English but I can't read the buttons to do so
08:05:38 <Dot> Not safw for woona
08:08:19 <Dot> .tell runbunny https://imgur.com/gallery/UmGfldQ
08:08:58 <Cane> I literally can't find the button to change the language lol
08:09:06 <Dot> hahaha
08:10:24 <Cane> Lemme dig through the configs for a bit, the scripts are always in english.
08:11:05 <Dot> use one of those apps on your phone where you can hold it up to writing and it translates it on the screen
08:11:32 <Cane> AHA, that did it.
08:13:49 <Dot> lol
08:20:43 <Cane> Dot, https://i.imgur.com/DL1afbh.jpg
08:21:05 <Dot> Great start!
08:21:20 <Cane> I should stream this.
08:22:31 <Dot> i wish Tarkov company wasnt too dodgy for you, you would love the game i think
08:23:41 <Cane> Hey, at least I've got my st_upd to keep me company. https://i.imgur.com/y2oVbdH.jpg
08:24:07 <Cane> That's every inventory item btw. It's just got the item reference id and a blank description.
08:24:24 <Dot> oh dear
08:32:18 <Cane> Walk 100 paces, get mauled by a Pseudogiant in one hit.
08:32:30 <Cane> That's the Misery part in Pain of Misery, one assumes.

10:32:03 <Cane> Dot, Pain of Misery has been a relative disappointment so far. Too much Pain and Misery, ironically.
10:32:24 <Cane> I don't like "realistic" mods that remove the stamina bar.
10:33:02 <Cane> Stamina is the single most unambigous stat that you can actually feel for yourself in real life.
10:33:23 <Cane> I know how exhausted I am when I'm jogging. I know how much I can push myself before I fall over.
10:34:02 <Cane> I also don't like "realistic" mods adding countless useless clutter items that may or may not have a use, but you'll never know unless you check the wiki.
10:34:37 <Cane> Doesn't help that all the items were called things like it_shtrsp_38 or whatever.
10:35:40 <Cane> I like that it made enemies better. I don't like that it did it by making them bullet spongy cybermen able to spot you through all foliage.
10:36:37 <Cane> I like that mutants like Chimera and Pseudogiants are stronger. I don't like that they instagib you, and effortlessly take down like 6 people, because if mutants that strong exist in droves then why does anyone ever enter the Red Forest?
10:36:52 <Cane> Seems like a good place to get killed, but there's loads of people trying to wander through it.
10:37:40 <Cane> I like that faction relations have a dynamic aspect to them, but I don't like that a scientist bunker or trading post can be guarded by people hostile to you while the actual merchants are friendly to you.
10:37:45 <Cane> There's so much shit that takes me out of it.
10:38:00 <Cane> Welp, time to try the other mod.
10:38:01 <reification> from what i've seen of your streaming it's a good place to get killed even without a new mod :p
10:38:40 <reification> wales got an early sunrise i see https://gfycat.com/forcefulpersonalfireant

11:36:12 <Cane> Dot, ok, so far I love Anomaly.
11:36:19 <Cane> The presentation is the best I've ever seen from a STALKER mod.
11:36:34 <Cane> It's got add-ons too, CoC style, which I should check out later.
11:38:49 <Cane> DOT
11:39:02 <Cane> ANOMALY HAS A BUILT IN RADIO PLAYER SO YOU CAN PLAY CHEEKI BREEKI
11:39:10 <Cane> I NEED TO ROLL BANDITS NOW
11:39:34 <Dot> HAHAHA
11:40:17 <Cane> Omfg I wonder if you can mod it to add whatever tracks you want. They're in .ogg format.
11:41:21 <Cane> YOU CAN
11:41:26 <Cane> It looks easy, script is fully commentated
11:42:19 <Cane> Oh I'm modding the shit out of this if I find out I like the mod.
11:42:44 <Cane> Dot, I found a new STALKER thing that I'm genuinely excited to experiment with. Today is a happy day. <3
11:43:57 <Cane> It's a 64-bit client that can handle way more stuff.

13:39:54 <Cane> Phear. <3
13:40:05 <Dot> is it stable cane?
13:41:40 <Cane> It crashed four times in a single firefight, then I set it from DirectX 8 to DirectX 9 and it's been fine so far.
13:41:49 <Cane> Will keep you posted.
13:44:04 <Cane> It's basically Misery Lite so far, in a Call of Chernobyl kind of setting but more vibrant.
13:44:17 <Cane> More NPCs and quests.
13:44:26 <Cane> More taxing on the system too though.

17:47:37 <Dot> i watched the original then was only told about brotherhood
17:47:42 <Dot> maybe one day i will watch it
17:47:49 <reification> i assume brotherhood is the better option for a new viewer?
17:49:47 <Bunny> I guess. There's merits to both series, but the overall concensus is that Brotherhood is better.
17:50:11 <reification> skram ^
17:50:39 <reification> i do see it is no. 1 on MAL
17:50:44 <Dot> its what ive heard too
17:51:08 <Bunny> it's more true to the manga. whereas the original series diviates.
