20:26:36 <DuB`> isekai*
20:26:37 <DuB`> There are at least half a dozen such manga
20:27:38 <skram> is manga like r34 in that it has every convievable scenario that will ever be concieved
20:27:39 <skram> and also porn
20:28:03 <DuB`> Probably close
20:28:51 <DuB`> There's one of a mermaid princess who discovers that she loves seafood and guiltily eats her former subjects at a sushi place
