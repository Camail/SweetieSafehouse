18:40:40 <Zounds> It was some sketchy NoteMachine one outside an off license rather than at a bank so I wasn't gonna hand it in there
18:40:56 <skram> polis?
18:41:37 <DoT`> ill accept ¬£100

19:13:31 <skram> how honest of you
19:14:29 <Zounds> ¬£100 goes a long way
19:16:21 <Runbunny> Don't they just grab it for themselves?
19:16:35 <Runbunny> I mean how are they going to locate the owner?
19:16:59 <Zounds> Fuck knows runbun

19:18:49 <Zounds> maybe not
19:18:53 <Zounds> but I wasn't going to steal it

23:08:25 <skram> are you involved in some sort of neo-nazi weeb community, reif?
23:08:29 <skram> i worry about these names
23:09:50 <reification> says the guy so known for loving loli hitler anime that i send him this... :p
23:11:24 <skram> i mean tanya is great and all but i cant remember mentioning it in public before
23:11:49 <reification> fear not skram i have never seen this account before this tweet
23:18:33 <skram> This is an odd twitter person reif
23:19:10 <reification> odd twitter ppl make best content
23:19:39 <skram> its like alt-right rhetoric but pro-trans and pictures of nazis but with anime grills
23:19:54 <reification> i blame 4chan
23:20:51 <skram> its always 4chans fault
23:27:39 <reification> welp i googled for a relevant meme i remembered and could only find it on a site that won't really lessen your concern skram 
23:28:12 <skram> oh dear

23:31:21 <reification> i think there was an april fools joke on 4chan where they merged the boards and then someone made a permanent version
23:31:51 <skram> marvelous
23:33:01 <Runbunny> The hacker 4chan hacked the twitter account obviously.
