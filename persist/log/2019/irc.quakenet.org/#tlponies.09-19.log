17:22:56 <Runbunny> Delve is soo good actually.
17:23:11 <Camail> yea, do you know about the drop bear strat?
17:23:16 <Runbunny> Nope.
17:23:36 <Camail> drop bears, beyond, and harbinger nodes are great xp/h, so you kill 95% of the mobs and log out
17:23:44 <Camail> and just redo th node over and over
17:24:06 <Camail> the close nodes are roughly 600-700 sulphite per run
