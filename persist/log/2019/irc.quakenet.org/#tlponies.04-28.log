07:27:48 <Dot> cane, youve spent a day gettign your own music and playlist into STALKER
07:27:59 <Dot> is this the next step on your way to coding your own mod?
07:28:54 <Cane> I've made lots of changes to Call of Chernobyl which are technically mods, including one where I added a whole new item like the leet haxor I am.
07:29:36 <Cane> Anyway, now my STALKER is walking around the rookie village blasting synthwave music, and getting funny looks I am sure.
07:29:55 <Cane> Hmm, can I rename the playlist in-game?
