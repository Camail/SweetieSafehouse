01:18:02 <DuB`> Camail, saw a couple things recommending I use this tempered kirin quest to farm a bunch of tempered ED tracks while I have it. Worth?
01:18:42 <Camail> sure
01:18:53 <Camail> i just did it normally, but i see the value
01:19:29 <DuB`> Sounds chill. I could use some chill
01:45:16 <Runbunny> Soon^tm Dub.
02:29:42 <DuB`> Oooh, ya. Got 7 tempered ED investigations out of 30 minutes following kirin around
02:29:45 <DuB`> Seems good
