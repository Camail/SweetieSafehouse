00:48:16 <DuB`> Today is like a friday
00:48:20 <DuB`> Pizza time I thinks
00:53:50 <Crisium> dubza
00:54:01 <DuB`> crimsimum
00:55:38 <DuB`> .choose TW CV pizza
00:55:43 <DuB`> hm hm
01:00:43 <Crisium> what kind of choice is that
01:00:48 <Crisium> vidya or food??
01:00:55 <DuB`> Haha
01:01:07 <DuB`> Maybe I do all three and am just choosing which first ;D
02:10:14 <Camail> code vein is good, lots of viable playstyles
02:10:50 <Camail> the bosses are kinda janky
02:10:57 <Camail> and most of them are anime tiddy
02:11:54 <Camail> but the story is engaging, and the game is quite fun. I'd say it's better than dark souls 2, but worse than ds3
02:13:16 <Camail> it's interesting that the game has two difficulties, stupidly easy co-op and quite hard solo
02:14:03 <Camail> they definitely had the casual anime tiddy market in mind when they designed the co-op partners
02:19:43 <DuB`> Interesting
02:22:03 <Camail> there's a kinda hidden thing that i think (havent finished the game yet) gives a better ending
02:22:16 <Camail> gotta find hidden things throughout the level before you beat the boss
02:22:44 <Camail> it's kinda lame that you don't realize that it matters, and is irreversible
02:24:01 <Camail> and one minor bad thing: the best armor that also lets you keep your light roll also looks really edgy and has terrible bloom affects
02:24:24 <Camail> been wearing the same armor since hour 2 and its glaring
02:24:38 <Camail> but it enables a RALLY fun playstyle
02:26:08 <Camail> it does have one boss with might be my favorite fight in any souls-like, maybe right under maria from bloodborne
02:43:22 <Runbunny> Sounds cool.
02:43:32 <Runbunny> I kinda skipped that one though.
02:43:48 <Runbunny> Also gotta sleep.
02:43:53 <Runbunny> Sleep forever.
02:44:57 <Camail> .tell runbunny good morning, u butt

07:46:50 <Dot|Phone> Hey Micen 
07:48:38 <Dot|Phone> You started your thanksgiving cooking yet? 
07:48:52 <Micen> yes actually 
07:49:02 <Micen> I have seafoam salad chilling in the fridge. 
07:49:31 <Dot|Phone> Lol
07:50:07 <Micen> thats been a tradition for years
07:55:15 <Micen> How do you all feel about a "Mesquite Smoked Maple Bacon Bourbon Pecan Pie"
08:14:01 <Dot|Phone> I was worried when I read mosquito
08:14:29 <Dot|Phone> And a don't drink alcohol, apart from that sounds well worth trying
08:45:55 <Micen> it sounds like too many flavors in the pie

09:40:51 <Dot|Phone> Is thanksgiving just a unspoken competition about who can use the weirdest ingredients and still have something ppl will eat
09:41:02 <Micen> ...no?
09:41:11 <Micen> its normal food. 
09:41:53 <Dot|Phone> There is nothing normal about bacon on a pecan pie or a seafoam salad
09:42:22 <Micen> seafoam salad is fruit suspended in jello and whipped cream. 
09:42:36 <Micen> the bacon thing is a bit strange, but that was the point of mentioning that 
09:43:13 <Dot|Phone> I saw that imgur list! 
09:44:11 <Micen> its mostly Turkey, sweet potatoes, non-sweet potatoes, peas, green beans (usually in the form of a casserole), corn, and then we do pies for dessert. 
09:44:43 <Dot|Phone> I'm suspicious 
09:45:08 <Micen> what sounds weird about that?
