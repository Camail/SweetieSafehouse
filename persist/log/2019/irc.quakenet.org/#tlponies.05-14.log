09:23:31 <DoT|Phone> Runbun!
09:35:20 <Runbunny> Hai!
09:42:36 <Rawr|Fone> Anders min v√§n
09:53:15 <Runbunny> Henrik!
09:53:52 <Runbunny> How is Malm√∂ these days? 
09:54:54 <Runbunny> We soon have an election here and some danish politicians are trying to use the scare tactic that if we don't do something about the muslim population we will have "swedish conditions"
09:55:07 <Runbunny> I am unsure what that entails.
09:56:29 <Golly> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wdpdxY8Y3Y
09:56:35 <Golly> this I reckon
09:56:57 <Golly> but with more brown people
09:59:10 <Rawr|Fone> I am unsure as well runbun
09:59:15 <Runbunny> So basically this Golly https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCDMGu-xi30
09:59:26 <Rawr|Fone> Seems like a good thing to be more like sweden
10:00:37 <Golly> we're all dead when the robot revolution happens anyway
10:00:40 <Rawr|Fone> I have been to denmark many times and it is quite a silly place
10:00:49 <DoT|Phone> Rawr not every place can handle being as silly as Sweden
10:02:21 <Runbunny> Like there's a part of Copenhagen that was often associated with immigrants, but it isn't really anymore.
10:02:54 <Runbunny> Politicians claims that part of the city is on fire, basically rioting and burning cars in the streets.
10:03:09 <Runbunny> Which isn't true at all.
10:05:41 <Rawr|Fone> It is the same here
10:06:05 <Rawr|Fone> Politicians in stockholm claim there are these "no-go zones"
10:06:15 <Rawr|Fone> Which is definitely not true
10:06:34 <Runbunny> Ahh yeah, I heard talk about those as well.

18:52:45 <DuB`> CPA license requires "continuing education" for future renewal, so perhaps not :P

18:54:08 <Dot`> as does most things
18:54:19 <Dot`> but i thought it would be a bit cruel to point it out
18:54:26 <DuB`> But no exams!
18:54:34 <Dot`> HAHAHA
18:55:15 <Dot`> you think being asked to do something at work you havnt done in ages and is very complex wont feel like an exam?
18:55:40 <DuB`> Naw
18:55:45 <DuB`> No multiple-choice questions ;D
18:56:17 <Dot`> just endless choices, normaly you can pick the "go to lunch" one at least
18:56:28 <DuB`> Hehe
18:57:27 <DuB`> "Where are you going?"  "... lunch!"  "Um, it's 9am"
18:58:05 <Dot`> or at 8 am "its been a long day this seems like a tomroow problem"
