17:30:45 <DuBtop> Liquid playing visage, o boi
17:30:53 <DuBtop> Excite
17:31:01 <DuBtop> But nerfed visage, so some worry :P
17:32:04 <Camail> dub are you excited about TL Marvel
17:32:14 <Camail> that's pretty nuts
17:33:34 <DuBtop> The wha
17:33:53 <Camail> team liquid partnered with marvel
17:34:17 <DoT`> fancy
17:34:17 <Camail> they have avengers jerseys
17:34:38 <Camail> i could care less about the merch, but the fact that disney is invested is a great sign for them
17:34:38 <DuBtop> Huh
17:34:48 <DuBtop> Yeah that's an unexpected combo
17:35:00 <Camail> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Fuvz0LN38
17:35:35 <Camail> i mean, it's terrifying if disney ever buys liquid
17:35:42 <Camail> that would be the worst possible outcome
17:35:52 <Camail> but partnerships are good
17:39:35 <DoT`> cam i was trying to get a dnd map to line up on roll20 and was having more trouble than normal
17:39:49 <DoT`> its a 3 story building and the tiles on the diffrent floors dont line up....
17:40:30 <Camail> cut the images out into 3 separate maps

18:05:32 <Camail> DoT` if you ever wanted to make quick money in poe you could buy pale court prophecies, beat the boss, then sell the key fragments
18:05:46 <Camail> there's a huge discrepancy in the ratios right now
18:06:15 <Camail> even for buying the maps to find the bosses
18:08:40 <DoT`> odd
18:11:27 <Camail> key prices are the same, but prophecies have unexpectedly high drop rates in legion
18:11:32 <Camail> the market hasn't adjusted
18:12:41 <Camail> unbreathing queen V is 4c, cemetery map is 2c, volkuur's key is 15c
18:12:47 <Camail> 7c flip every few minutes
18:13:10 <Camail> you could completely flood the market, and i think the demand is high enough for you to do it without ruining the ratio
18:13:41 <Camail> honestly shocked that no one is doing this yet
18:14:04 <DuBtop> Out for delivery at 9:20am. Expected delivery: By End of Day
18:14:09 <DuBtop> Nice window
