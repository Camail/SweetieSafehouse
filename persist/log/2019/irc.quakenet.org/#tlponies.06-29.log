14:38:23 <Zounds> It's going pretty good DoT` actually was up there a few days ago
14:38:43 <DoT`> nice!
14:39:45 <DoT`> so you work for a comany that gets outsourced to events then right? how bigs the company?
14:42:50 <Zounds> Not gigantic but not small either. I think it's around 2500 people over the UK
14:43:13 <Zounds> We're a pretty big deal in scotland but getting bigger down in england aswell nowadays
14:43:17 <DoT`> thats a fair size
14:43:33 <Zounds> still tiny compared to company like G4S :P
14:44:41 <DoT`> the company does more than just general public event securty?
14:44:55 <Zounds> Yeah that's just a part of it
14:45:00 <DoT`> these GS4 ppl from a quick look like they do a lot
14:45:27 <Zounds> we also do CCTV and pubs/clubs and close protection
14:45:32 <Zounds> close protection = bodyguarding
14:46:35 <DoT`> fancy
14:46:59 <Zounds> yeh sometimes us plebs in events cross path with the close protection guys
14:47:03 <Zounds> they're pretty much what you'd expect
14:47:21 <Golly> beefcakeeeee
14:47:30 <DoT`> bored out of thier minds probably

14:48:56 <Zounds> the close protection are more like quiet professionals
14:49:13 <Golly> makes sense
14:51:55 <Golly> need speed to jump in front of bulit
15:01:49 <Zounds> there's lots of scottish pixies in the new ffxiv expansion DoT`
15:01:55 <Zounds> I think you'd like it
15:02:08 <DoT`> i am a fan of scottish pixies?
15:02:15 <DoT`> sure
15:02:48 <Bio> morn horsne
15:02:56 <Bio> coffee time
15:03:00 <DoT`> hedge
15:03:54 <Zounds> you like scottish accents
15:04:19 <Zounds> or maybe that was skrammen lad
15:04:21 <Zounds> it was somebody
15:04:45 <skram> dont tell them my secret zounds
15:05:21 <DoT`> who doesnt like scottish accents?
15:05:25 <Zounds> so it was u
15:05:46 <DoT`> skram too
15:05:46 <skram> some kids visited the plant i work at some time ago because they had to do a project about bioenergy or whatever
15:06:15 <skram> and since they werent able to film a whole lot they recreated the entire plant in minecraft and used that as the base for their presentation
15:06:20 <skram> im honestly impressed
15:06:24 <Zounds> That's cool
15:06:43 <Zounds> bet they had fun with that
15:06:55 <skram> sure looked like it
15:11:12 <DoT`> i reuire pictures skram
15:11:30 <DoT`> ewquire

15:14:38 <skram> no this is a serious campaign and we will behave accordingly
15:15:08 <DoT`> right after some bagpipe serenades
15:16:35 <DoT`> zounds, how do you feel knowing every skram dnd charcter plays bagpipes
15:17:15 <skram> 5th dwarf character with bagpipe proficiency
15:17:20 <skram> first one to actually own bagpipes
15:17:40 <Zounds> don't try to serenade somebody with them
15:18:48 <Bio> this strongholds book is nicely made dot
15:19:01 <DoT`> i look forward to getting mine
15:19:11 <skram> i did, zounds
15:19:15 <DoT`> probably arrive while im in au
15:19:17 <skram> people cried because it was so beautiful
15:19:30 <DoT`> they cried
15:20:04 <Zounds> I like bagpipes, more than the average scot maybe
15:20:44 <Zounds> however I don't think they're best suited to a serenade
15:21:17 <skram> so you dont think i would be able to seduce you with some tender bagpipe music
15:23:06 <Zounds> what does tender bagpipe music even sound like
15:23:21 <DoT`> so your saying theres a chance
15:23:59 <Zounds> they can be romantic if you're a handsome lone piper playing a song bringing to mind the beauty of the glens
15:24:17 <Zounds> but you'd have to cut an imposing figure in the distance
15:24:23 <Zounds> not playing softly and tenderly
15:24:52 <skram> i dont know zounds but im gonna find out
15:26:30 <Zounds> maybe the hurdy gurdy is more your speed
15:26:45 <DoT`> did you not have a dorf with that too skram?
15:27:10 <skram> i dont think a hurdy gurdy is a weapon of romance
15:27:17 <skram> pfft never
