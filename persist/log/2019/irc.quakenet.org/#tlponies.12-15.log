00:54:48 <Dot`> skram, im glad you are not dead
00:54:59 <skram> thanks buddy
00:56:57 <skram> despite my pals best efforts to poison me with akevitt, I am still alive
01:10:31 <skram> how was dnd Dot`
01:13:12 <Dot`> great, we didnt die
01:13:18 <Dot`> but someoen did hit me
01:13:23 <skram> how rude
01:13:31 <skram> what are you playing in this campaign
01:14:07 <Dot`> wizard
01:14:19 <Dot`> i made some skeletal rats float
01:14:44 <skram> what a day
01:15:13 <Runbunny> Well done Dot.
01:15:25 <Dot`> party needs a barbarian tohugh, sad times
01:17:36 <skram> every party needs a barbarian
01:21:04 <Dot`> we have killed many cultists and found a spooky coin
01:28:43 <skram> how do you know the cultists were bad
01:29:07 <Dot`> they didnt knock on doors before opening them
01:29:13 <Dot`> they where rude
01:29:57 <skram> not everyone who knocks on doors are bad people, Dot`
01:32:50 <Dot`> well thye didnt knock on doors at all
01:34:58 <skram> terribly rude
02:00:55 <skram> DuB` I poked a lovebird todayt
02:03:59 <Runbunny> O:
02:12:24 <Crisium|2> skram be my lovebird
02:12:27 <Camail> runbun i found an ex while farming for imperial legacy
02:12:54 <Camail> multi tasking buying div cards and farming div cards was intense
02:13:09 <skram> oh crisium bby ;)
02:18:24 <Runbunny> Sweet.
02:18:59 <Runbunny> I used 4c to craft flat phys on a dagger.

02:24:53 <DuB`> We had two lovebirds when I was like 12
02:24:58 <DuB`> They were kinda mean though haha
02:38:17 <skram> Apparently this one was from a bad home and pretty sceptical of humans
02:55:36 <Camail> yo skram this poe league is fun as hell
02:55:51 <Camail> you take bits from monsters and mash them together and then kill THAT thing
02:56:09 <Camail> and then THAT drops a part and you mash THOSE parts together to kill an even BIGGER thing
03:01:46 <Runbunny> But sometimes you take too strong bits from the monsters and you get a piece of shit that one shots you.
03:02:26 <Runbunny> Also it has black spells/abilities and it also makes the ground black so you're literally looking for something black in the black
03:12:00 <Crisium> DuB' have any room in your stack?

03:29:48 <Camail> the biggest killer is the little bugs
03:29:55 <Camail> they're like volatile dead x50

17:39:51 <Camail> if i was solo it wouldv'e been faster
17:40:00 <Camail> but my brother bought a pc literally for this game sooo
17:40:29 <Dot`> oh cool
17:40:41 <Dot`> one day is super fast first time
17:41:37 <Camail> it isn't his first time, but he's relatively casual
17:41:42 <Camail> he played ps4
17:41:47 <Camail> so it is his first time with a keyboard
17:42:50 <Camail> enemy life was increased a ton this league, and adding that to the normal multiplayer life bonus is...woof
17:42:54 <Camail> lots of life on stuff
17:43:29 <Camail> he died in the third lab and i had to solo the entire thing with the boss having double health
17:48:11 <Runbunny> I haven't messed around the atlas much
