22:06:42 <skram> a bio
22:06:43 <skram> hey
22:06:51 <skram> did you know that you can just deep fry cheese
22:06:52 <skram> and eat it

22:07:07 <Bio> you know
22:07:09 <Bio> i did know that
22:07:19 <Bio> approve.
22:08:38 <skram> theres like proteins and stuff in cheese, right? 
22:08:51 <skram> that means its fine to eat it for breakfast, dinner, and lunch maybe
22:10:54 <Bio> yes
22:13:00 <skram> ok good
22:13:00 <Camail> skram eat non-cheese pls
22:13:14 <Camail> pooping is important
22:14:26 <skram> cheese doesnt stop you poopin...?
22:22:55 <Bio> ?biostream
22:22:59 <Bio> ffx 
22:23:02 <Bio> badly
22:25:41 <Runbunny> skram.
22:25:57 <Runbunny> Dot was very concerned.
22:26:26 <skram> concerned about what, runbuns?
22:29:26 <Runbunny> Your well being.
22:29:35 <skram> ah
22:29:41 <skram> that sounds like a waste of time
22:30:39 <Runbunny> He wanted me to invade Norway... again.
22:31:26 <skram> i double dog dare you
22:32:03 <Camail> ooh
22:32:30 <Camail> i have the highest dps + survivability for mana guardians
22:33:37 <Camail> and considering it doesn't count frost bite or the frost bolt ice nova interaction... i'm probably in top 5
22:34:10 <skram> there's leaderboards?
22:34:26 <Runbunny> Yeh.
22:35:35 <Camail> playing off meta means i can be the best much easier :P
22:36:12 <Camail> the other class is trickster ice nova
22:36:26 <Camail> but having the highest es of my archetype feels good
23:01:00 <Runbunny> Imma sleep.
