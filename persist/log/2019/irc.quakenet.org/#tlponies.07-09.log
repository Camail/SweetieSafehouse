14:59:04 <Camail> then he'll talk to me
14:59:10 <Camail> and i just need time away from him right now
14:59:45 <Camail> man, once i get a job i want to visit you guys
14:59:55 <Camail> me and dub can travel together
15:10:17 <Dot`> i napped a bit
15:10:26 <Dot`> and drooled it seems
15:10:34 <Dot`> cam, when you getting a job
15:10:44 <Camail> as soon as i can
15:11:00 <Dot`> what kind of job?
15:11:30 <Dot`> at this point i thought you where just part of the mafia and had old family money on offshore accounts
15:15:37 <Dot`> i know you studied something computer related, but dont know the exact thing
15:17:13 <Camail> i'm trying to be a data engineer, but at this point a normal software engineer would be fine
15:17:56 <Dot`> oh ,thats cool
15:18:58 <Dot`> would you take dub in a suitecase? 
15:19:25 <Camail> well, hopefully
15:19:34 <Camail> because the other option is a pet carrier
15:19:53 <Dot`> are dubs shots up to date?
15:20:38 <Camail> well he went abroad a few years ago so i think so
15:21:05 <Camail> .tell dub` hey are you an anti-vaxxer, and how well do you do in small spaces?
15:21:10 <Camail> we'll find out soon enough
15:21:28 <Dot`> its good to plan in advance
15:24:52 <Dot`> i dled all the crit roll to watch so i had something to do in the 24 hour transit, then i got  a migrain 4 hours into travel
15:25:01 <Camail> yea i saw, that's rough
15:25:12 <Camail> well you'll be traveling back
15:25:16 <Camail> so that's a chance
15:25:31 <Camail> i had a migraine last night, drugs solved that problem
15:25:38 <Camail> you should stock up on drugs before you travel home
15:25:47 <Camail> but it's a pain to travel with drug in luggage
15:25:53 <Camail> just stick them up your butt
15:26:10 <Dot`> your very good at panning ahead
15:26:15 <Camail> be an OTC drug mule
15:26:28 <Camail> i'm the best planner
15:27:10 <Runbunny> Are we kidnapping Dub?
15:27:23 <Dot`> give up softeawre engineering and become an event orginiser cam
15:27:48 <Dot`> and no runbun, he wants to travel, im sure, we wont bother asking him though
15:27:50 <Camail> gonna organize so many events about butts
15:28:13 <Camail> that would probably be popular, tho
15:28:14 <Dot`> buttcon
15:28:37 <Runbunny> That's kidnapping Dot.

15:29:31 <Dot`> wouldnt you like a holiday runbun?

17:55:10 <DuB`> But yes she's much more enjoyable now haha
17:57:13 <Camail> skram if you want to make a lot of money without doing any work you can flip essences of dread
17:57:25 <Camail> there's no mapping like the pale court flips
17:57:46 <Camail> i just made 25c easily
18:08:12 <Camail> being juiced up is fun
18:08:17 <Camail> i can only imagine what a HH is like
18:08:32 <Camail> all i need to do is convert to an ele build
18:08:41 <Camail> which will take some time, but this is fun for now
18:15:14 <Camail> but... I'm poor again
18:28:18 <skram> whaddaya mean flippin
18:28:22 <skram> you just buy and sell?
18:28:52 <Camail> you buy 9 screaming essences of dread, convert them to deafening, and sell back
18:29:10 <Camail> screaming cost ~5 each if you're patient, deafening cost 70c
18:29:26 <Camail> thats a 45c investment for 25c profit
18:29:31 <skram> how do you convert em
18:29:39 <Camail> you just sell 3 to a vendor
18:29:46 <skram> oh i see
18:29:48 <Camail> it's seriously that easy, but people are dumb and dont do it
18:30:13 <Camail> usually essences level out, but dread are SO popular that it's been out of whack this league
18:30:49 <Camail> oh, 80c, so 35c profit
18:35:22 <Camail> right now i'm not even playing, i have a live alert on poetrade for cheap dreads
