00:33:43 <skram> DuB`
00:45:02 <DuB`> skram
00:46:03 <skram> good
00:48:01 <DuB`> UM
00:48:12 <DuB`> Wha's good my friend
00:48:29 <skram> its u
00:50:08 <Camail> DuB`  skram came to me in my hour of need
00:50:11 <Camail> then he broke my door down
00:50:24 <DuB`> No free lunch
00:50:26 <Camail> and harassed me with pumpkins
00:50:27 <skram> pls i gave you a pumpkin
00:50:32 <skram> for FREE
00:51:01 <Camail> we got super corn now, which is great
00:51:27 <Camail> you need to log on sometime and dig out a room
00:56:37 <DuB`> Sounds like hard work
00:56:40 <DuB`> What if I get sweaty
00:58:27 <Camail> we have 3 tier 6 augers
00:58:30 <Camail> we'll find a wayt
01:17:38 <skram> well we have timed charges too
01:18:24 <Camail> no
01:18:26 <Camail> no you dont
01:18:36 <Camail> you literal home wrecker!
01:18:54 <skram> can i at least blow up the old house
01:24:40 <Camail> i thought you liked that house
01:27:00 <skram> i do
01:27:03 <skram> i also like explosions
01:52:00 <Camail> fine
01:52:03 <Camail> you can blow it up
01:52:13 <Camail> but you need to build something to replace it
01:52:32 <Camail> you have your room in the bunker, and you can have a cabin on the pond
01:52:36 <Camail> best of both worlds
01:59:57 <DuB`> Hmm
02:00:19 <DuB`> Is ff14 the good MMO right now? I know we have some that play that in tlp
02:00:33 <DuB`> It has a 30 day free trial and I'm in the mood to try
02:00:40 <DuB`> Haven't touched an mmo since, like, middle school

02:06:31 <DuB`> Oh not free trial I guess
02:13:20 <Camail> the free trial is to lvl 30
02:13:33 <Camail> its worth trying
02:13:43 <Camail> i enjoyed my time playing it, basically as a single player game
02:14:04 <Camail> i no loner have any interest, but would still recommend it to people
02:14:24 <Camail> i think runbun and zounds play
02:14:48 <Camail> you cant really play with people unless you're at the same level of progress tho
02:15:13 <Camail> because there's no reason to make a second character, you can't easily join in with friends who already play
02:21:00 <DuB`> ya
02:36:18 <Camail> its a game where you can get to 30, but the full game, and it usually comes with like a month free
02:36:40 <Camail> i was able to do all the content up to but not including end game
02:36:49 <Camail> the bosses are cinematic as fuck
02:37:25 <Camail> the shiva fight is soooooo cool
02:38:05 <Camail> but the full game*
02:38:07 <Camail> buy*
02:38:11 <Camail> >_>
02:38:28 <Camail> thats what i did, at the time it was right before the 2nd expansion so it was quite cheap
02:45:31 <Camail> sktam go to sleep
02:45:36 <Camail> zzz
04:51:45 <skram> .tell camail i do what i want
