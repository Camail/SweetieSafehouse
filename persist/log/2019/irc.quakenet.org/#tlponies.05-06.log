15:23:35 <Runbunny> Reif btw.
15:23:50 <Runbunny> Can you give me a brexit update? It was postpone but for how long?
15:24:10 <reification> til halloween 
15:24:23 <Runbunny> Ah I see.
15:24:40 <reification> both main parties got rekt at local elections last week over it
15:25:12 <Runbunny> The no brexit option is still available no?
15:25:17 <reification> new brexit party is leading polls for euro elections later this month
15:26:29 <Runbunny> Which means that most people want a brexit still.
15:26:31 <Runbunny> Hmm.
15:27:02 <reification> sure, also the queen can dissolve parliament and direct rule
15:27:19 <reification> both would be *major* crises tho
15:27:48 <reification> polling has always been around 50/50 for brexit for years
15:31:40 <reification> kinda related: i highly recommend this podcast, the first episode explaining how trying to integrate britain into europe worked out 2000 years ago https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1whRd_c_irk
15:32:34 <reification> (if you want vikings skip ahead to ep 4)
15:37:20 <reification> runbun only hear about danish politics from this twitter account https://twitter.com/PopulismUpdates/status/1125201962708787200
15:38:09 <reification> also it occurs to me there is some echo between the recent ukraine election and the end of the podcast i linked
15:53:21 <Runbunny> Uhg.
15:54:01 <Runbunny> That guy the twitter is talking about is a big mess in Denmark currently.
15:56:15 <Runbunny> He is intentionally provoking immigrants and then films it, so whenever he's attacked he seems like he is right in his opinions.
15:57:59 <reification> seems a bit westboro baptist church 
15:58:13 <Runbunny> Spent a lot of tax money by holding "demonstrations" which is legal so police has to step in to keep the peace, which enforces the "police vs immigrants" mentality.
15:58:48 <Runbunny> He has been gaining traction in the poles.
15:59:48 <Runbunny> He's claims are outrageous, but the people who shows up to these things are giving him exactly what he wants.
15:59:54 <Runbunny> and it's so dumb.
16:00:43 <Runbunny> Since if you don't give him the time of day, he wouldn't have any influence at all. I think.
16:01:04 <reification> almost certainly
16:01:21 <reification> i go walk now. laters
