10:54:54 <Runbunny> I for once remembered what I dreamt.
10:55:45 <Runbunny> It was a horrible dream. Like 4 people betayed me.
10:56:13 <Runbunny> and I was powerless to stop it. 
10:56:55 <Runbunny> I was shocked.
10:57:43 <Dot`> was i one?

13:19:07 <reification> i also had a re
13:19:20 <reification> rare dream rememberance
13:19:36 <reification> i was back in dorchester-on-thames
13:19:38 <Runbunny> I most surely hope not.
13:19:59 <Runbunny> What is that? a prison?
13:20:27 <reification> which i assume came to mind as i learned my niece is moving there last week
13:20:51 <reification> i used to live there when i worked near oxford, it's a very nice place
13:21:29 <reification> which is why they won't be able to afford a proper house
13:21:34 <Runbunny> Ahh, that sounds like a nice dream.
13:22:24 <reification> actually i screwed up in it but ppl were nice and understanding...
13:23:08 <Runbunny> I just couldn't believe what was happening.
