18:06:18 <Camail> skreem
18:09:27 <skrma> wanna play with some zombos
18:11:21 <Camail> in a bit, i have some stuff i need to get done atm
18:11:35 <Camail> i almost finished the garage
18:11:41 <skrma> cool cool
18:11:47 <Camail> but the ramps are too steep...
18:12:01 <Camail> so you need to like, make a bunch of ramps and landings to smooth it out
18:13:33 <skrma> when are we getting a train
18:13:50 <BioPhone> Soon tm
18:14:39 <Camail> there are no trains
18:14:47 <Camail> helecopters yea
18:14:58 <Camail> oh also we have a lot of stone
18:15:12 <Camail> i think i mined like 20k stone while digging the garage
18:15:33 <Camail> but now i can make lvl 5 tools so i can start making steel and motor tools
18:15:40 <skrma> nice
18:15:57 <skrma> can get started on moving the entire base too i guess
18:16:40 <Camail> eh, we'd need an actual plan before we move
18:16:50 <skrma> plans are the worst
18:16:57 <Camail> plans are why we're alive
18:17:16 <skrma> im still alive mostly because repsawning exists
18:17:41 <Camail> true
18:20:51 <Camail> though the garage could very easily just turn into a bloodmoon bunker
