07:51:06 <reification> hey dotties
07:51:55 <reification> you don't need to worry about the suspension of parliament
07:52:20 <reification> it's only effectively for a few days and overdue at that
07:53:49 <DoT|Phone> it's for a month isn't it?
07:53:57 <reification> you have to remember MPs are real lazy
07:54:38 <reification> they have 3 weeks off for conferences almost immediately after huge summer break
07:56:06 <reification> it looks more like a bait to freak out the opposition and get them to do something dumb
07:58:56 <reification> now if they had suspended from now til november...
08:09:20 <DoT|Phone> I heard mp summer break mentioned. what the hell is that
08:10:24 <reification> they have 6 weeks or so off in summer dot

21:29:18 <skram> yes
21:29:29 <skram> thats why they speak danish in malmÃ¶
21:29:58 <DoT`> does rawr have a danish swedish accent?
21:30:27 <skram> sort of i guess
21:30:46 <skram> i havent heard henrik speak swedish but skÃ¥ne is danish-ish
21:31:26 <Camail> are runbun and rawr the same person
21:31:41 <Camail> you euros live so close to each other
21:32:04 <Runbunny> O:
21:32:42 <skram> runbun is henriks complete lack of morals
21:33:08 <Runbunny> I have plently of morals.

21:33:38 <Runbunny> How else am I going to break them?
21:33:58 <skram> that logic seems twisted
21:36:50 <Camail> Aristotle said the worst kind of person is the one who knows what is right and deliberately does the opposite
21:37:12 <Camail> so runbun is literally the worst
21:37:18 <Camail> it checks out
21:42:17 <skram> poor runbun
21:47:25 <DoT`> runbun is a worshiper of slannesh, so probably enjoys it
21:47:58 <Camail> spell their name right you unworthy fuk
21:49:18 <DoT`> nah
21:49:39 <skram> you're the worst

22:02:14 <Camail> i haven't picked a build yet
22:02:37 <Camail> i want something with good clear speed, but preferably not meta
22:03:00 <skram> I kinda wanna try plague herald again tbh
22:03:09 <Camail> herald of agony, but yes
22:03:13 <skram> yeyeye
22:03:13 <Camail> thats gonna be hella strong
22:03:29 <Camail> stormbrand hoag is very strong
22:03:50 <Camail> too slow for me but maybe this league will make it faster

22:08:06 <Camail> i kinda wanna do poison, i like accumulating damage as a mechanic
22:11:54 <Camail> but above all, i want to play at range
22:12:13 <Camail> so if all the poison garbo is melee then i'll throw it all away
22:16:17 <DuB`> Cam I forgot to go finish my last d3 conquest and didn't get the wings :P
22:16:25 <Camail> woops

22:17:02 <Camail> the d3 ones look cooler, wish i could get those in poe
22:17:15 <Camail> get them without paying $30*
22:31:33 <skram> DuB` im counting on you to reciprocate my carefully curated youtube recoms with some bloops
22:31:42 <DuB`> o oke

22:37:14 <Runbunny> kommunal pop?
22:39:42 <skram> whats that runbun
22:39:43 <DuB`> Hmmm I mostly have slow swoopy bassy things from this week
22:40:47 <Runbunny> you linked me something a few years ago and I don't remember the name, except it was like "kommunal musik"
22:40:59 <skram> DuB`: https://gulfaudiocompany.bandcamp.com/album/--3
22:41:53 <skram> i have no idea what you're talking about, runbun :P
22:42:34 <skram> DuB`: This too https://gulfaudiocompany.bandcamp.com/track/yesterdays-jam
22:43:17 <DuB`> Better than the first one :P
22:43:31 <skram> ppft
22:43:36 <skram> these are all tasty as HECK
22:43:49 <DuB`> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Kurt2VwVg
22:44:21 <DuB`> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1VmWx0JeRA
22:44:38 <Camail> dub this bass is too mellow
22:44:42 <Camail> i'mma have to arrest you
22:44:46 <Camail> for being too chill
22:45:11 <DuB`> Well I don't HAVE to hold back the weirder ones  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZpZ_pAZYjU
22:45:14 <skram> second one is better
22:45:28 <skram> its got that synth thing that goes wappwappwappa
22:46:02 <DuB`> wappawappa is the best description of it, yes
22:46:17 <Camail> its like flailing around a riding crop in the air
22:46:27 <Camail> or a stick
22:46:42 <DuB`> Third one is more like THUNKAWOPPAWOPPA
22:46:43 <skram> ah hey did i tell you i played amnesia scanner to my 60 year old dad rock fanatic coworker real loud?
22:46:49 <DuB`> Ya ya
22:47:48 <skram> i dont think he's gotten over it yet
22:47:57 <DuB`> Bahahaha
22:48:09 <Camail> in a good or bad way?
22:48:41 <skram> honestly im not sure
22:48:46 <Camail> dub
22:48:53 <DuB`> AS is somethin
22:48:54 <Camail> this third song has a point where i think he drops a bunch of sivlerware
22:48:57 <Camail> silverware*
22:49:01 <DuB`> haha
22:49:27 <skram> i really dig AS but like 3 songs in a row is enough for a while
22:50:32 <Camail> just googled them
22:50:58 <Camail> this bass is going so low its making me physically squirm
22:51:12 <Camail> i dont think i like that
22:51:29 <Camail> maybe i should close my headphones
22:51:39 <skram> what sort of stuff do you usually listen to cam
22:51:53 <Camail> nothing
22:52:03 <Camail> i dont listen to music usually
22:52:21 <DuB`> Pretty sure I put this one here a while ago already? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz7V_IQDy2w
22:52:26 <DuB`> It also has wappawappawappa

22:55:58 <Camail> someone played this song on loop for their child
22:56:01 <Camail> for like 3 months
22:56:12 <Camail> thats the only explanation on how the algorithm fucked up so bad
22:56:51 <Camail> dub i like the whapwhap but its not arrhythmic enough
22:56:57 <Camail> needs that geriatric whap
22:57:03 <skram> lol
22:57:33 <DuB`> There's a sentence
22:57:56 <DuB`> With a very specific meaning
22:58:30 <skram> how about some sad piano music ft. creaky piano chair https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9t3mbv2Hd8
23:02:22 <Camail> dub how much did you learn about japanese noise music while in weebland
23:04:18 <DuB`> Noise music?
23:05:04 <skram> its like music
23:05:06 <skram> but with noise
23:05:22 <Camail> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhNvAduJe9k

23:06:35 <skram> this is proper weird, camail
23:06:37 <skram> i kinda like it
23:07:00 <Camail> i had brief contact with it years and years ago
23:07:10 <Camail> fairly polarizing
23:07:31 <skram> yeah no doubt
23:08:51 <skram> sort of like musique concrete i guess
23:12:14 <DuB`> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr_jVqe1OH4

23:13:22 <Camail> dot is this what you're gonna waste all your big bucks on
23:13:27 <Camail> a bunch of synth modules
23:13:30 <Camail> dub*
23:13:42 <DuB`> I think skram is more likely :P
23:13:53 <Camail> you're gonna let skram spend your big bucks?
23:13:54 <Camail> how kind
23:13:59 <Camail> skram give me some of his money too
23:14:02 <skram> thankfully skram doesnt have the kind of money it takes to get a proper modular setup
23:14:13 <DuB`> No but apparently I need to send dot an ssd for christmas
23:14:23 <DuB`> Poor boy doesn't even have his own terabyte
23:14:33 <Camail> you dont needs a tb ssd
23:14:44 <DuB`> Terabyte of anything!
23:14:46 <skram> that modular rack he's using is easily 10k$
23:15:02 <Camail> steal a car
23:15:03 <Camail> sell the car
23:15:16 <Camail> ez 10k
23:15:27 <Camail> 10k euros or usd
23:15:38 <Camail> noth that it matters lul ty greece
23:16:04 <skram> I have entertained the thought of building my own a few times but i've got no space to tinker really
23:16:19 <skram> its not super complicated electronics or anything
23:16:38 <Camail> loft your bed
23:16:57 <skram> my bedroom is too small even without the bed
23:17:32 <skram> but im going to look at a house on thurs that has like 3 bedrooms so that'd give me some space to fuck around
23:18:03 <DuB`> A whole harem
23:18:05 <Camail> and thus the tlp harem house was born
23:18:11 <skram> LO
23:18:12 <skram> L

23:18:21 <DuB`> Your phrasing

23:20:13 <skram> no minors, cam
23:20:16 <skram> miners welcome though
23:20:40 <Camail> yes obviously, but we know how deep the depravity goes
23:20:44 <Camail> so swimming on the surface is fine
23:21:33 <skram> man are you gonna look like a dummy when we flood the surface with lava
