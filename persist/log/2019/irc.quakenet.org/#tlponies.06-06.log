18:58:10 <Camail> wow no one had it installed
18:58:14 <Camail> truly tlp had given up hope
18:58:49 <Dot`> i think skrma is like max lvl in that game
18:59:05 <Camail> so apparently the new dragon age was gonna be like origins, but the publishers didn't want that so they scrapped it
18:59:18 <Dot`> dam....
18:59:21 <skraam> shame
18:59:22 <Camail> there aren't a lot of things that make me sad, but boy is that one of them

19:14:21 <skraam> thats not what miners look like zounds
19:22:52 <Zounds> well her class was miner and she looked like that
19:22:56 <Zounds> she has the pick and everything!
19:23:03 <Zounds> so clearly they do
19:23:23 <skraam> i wonder what sort of mining she does
19:23:32 <skraam> dont think you need a straw hat in a coal mine
19:23:58 <Dot`> have you worked in a coal mine skram?
19:23:59 <Camail> it soaks up all the black lung
19:24:30 <Zounds> mostly you're bashing rocks out in the hot sun as miner in ffxiv so straw hat isn't actually the worst :P
19:24:55 <Dot`> skram doesn tbelieve in open pit mines
19:25:01 <Camail> real mining isn't a great gameplay loop
19:25:30 <skraam> unless you're a fan of heavy equipment simulator 2019
19:26:20 <Zounds> that catgirl is also my guild leader
19:26:29 <Zounds> nice lady from portugal

19:27:11 <Camail> as a former ff14 catgirl i cant tell you it's legit
19:27:18 <Camail> can*

19:28:32 <Camail> the glamor is dumb, armor should be armor
19:29:03 <Zounds> fuck that cam

19:29:55 <Camail> eh, sexualization is boring and jarring
19:30:27 <Camail> makes everything just look eclectic and confused

22:58:57 <Cane> I'm pondering PoE builds.
22:59:15 <Cane> How do people figure out what good league starters are before the league has begun anyway? Test realms?
23:29:34 <reification> night all
23:35:33 <Camail> Cane they look at early gem's level progression and what unique are common and if they're good for the build
23:36:20 <Camail> a league starter is a cheap build with a potentially lower ceiling, but it's enough to get to red maps based mostly on leveling gems and passives
23:36:41 <Camail> and once you in red maps you can do high quantity maps and get enough currency to make other builds
23:37:05 <Camail> or you play contagion ED, which is just really really good no matter what
23:37:34 <Camail> also path of building
23:37:48 <Cane> I used Path of Building a lot to mess with numbers for a couple of my builds back then.
23:37:55 <Cane> The actual program was great.
23:37:57 <Camail> you won't see any builds give detailed gem layouts because they aren't in PoB yet
23:38:02 -!- Rawr|Fone [~AndChat52@84-217-62-32.customers.ownit.se] has joined #tlponies
23:38:35 <Camail> but tons of people are looking at the numbers for the skill tree, and builds with low travel time and strong early ascendancies are also real good
23:39:24 <Camail> staffs have 10% endurance charge on crit
23:39:27 <Camail> that's pretty nice
23:39:33 <Camail> from the tree, obv
