18:05:45 <Camail> hullo zounds
18:06:44 <Camail> Runbunny i'd rather keep it as a trophy, it's corrupted
18:06:59 <Runbunny> Ahh.
18:06:59 <Camail> it's a armor/evasion chest piece
18:07:06 <Camail> it's so, so so bad
18:07:07 <Runbunny> THROW IT INTO THE FIRE!
18:07:31 <Camail> it might get deleted on the move to standard
18:07:41 <Camail> might make a character just to hold it
18:07:53 <Camail> gonna delete my map mules from normal synth
18:08:19 <Camail> i got up to t8 maps in flashback, and i completed the build
18:08:25 <Camail> i think i'm done until legion
18:08:33 <Runbunny> It's only a week.
18:09:02 <Runbunny> You can still have it standard.
18:09:22 <Camail> i did everything i wanted to
18:09:35 <Runbunny> But your limited stash space will be sucky.
18:10:20 <Camail> standard is a graveyard
18:11:13 <Camail> i'm happy with where she's at, i got all 4 curses running
18:11:17 <Camail> two 5 links
18:11:47 <Camail> haven't pushed to see how far i can get, but idc about that really
18:12:49 <Camail> wow tabulas in flashback are twice the price of synth
18:13:20 <Camail> wait no, they're 20c in synth now too
18:13:24 <Camail> fuckin inflation
18:13:34 <Camail> back in my day you could buy TWO tabulas with that
18:13:48 <Camail> and a tootsie roll
18:24:19 <Runbunny> Yeah that always happen doing league ends
18:24:45 <Runbunny> Fear of missing out probably plays into it as well
18:25:28 <Runbunny> Hmm.. tabula is 30c in standard :D
18:26:04 <Runbunny> Even shitty corrupted ones
18:27:23 <Camail> lul
18:28:17 <Camail> poe trade has a non-public tab option with forum threads and that one application

19:12:06 <Phearlock> They're obviously fighting over him.
19:12:17 <Phearlock> They can't agree on who gets the skram
19:12:20 <skram> naw naw
19:13:15 <skram> We had planned startup on saturday, but it got pushed back so they want me to work monday instead
19:14:00 <skram> since startup is a lot of work and is gonna take about 3 days and they need a monkey to turn some valves and stuff
19:27:43 <Camail> you should just take all their money
19:27:44 <Dot`> skram is best monkey?
19:29:59 <skram> probably
19:30:37 <skram> its cheaper to replace the monkey that gets his face melted off when the stem seal fails and sprays superheated steam everywhere than an actual human bean i guess

19:52:59 <Camail> vaal arc was a good first build, i had fun with it
19:53:04 <Dot`> i need you to get 4 builds that compliment eachother and synergise well 
19:53:37 <Camail> i dont know anything about team comps
19:54:27 <Camail> also we dont have 4 people cuz runbun is playing on league start

19:55:55 <Camail> he has said he doesn't like poe
19:56:11 <Dot`> oh right
19:56:26 <Dot`> i dont know, i just lug dub in when we play games
19:57:04 <Camail> i'd like him to, but we'd need to find the right build that has enough active skills
19:57:11 <Camail> he doesn't like building around a single skill
19:57:26 <Camail> and those are the most common
19:57:32 <Dot`> *plays D3 all the time*
19:57:35 <Camail> ikr
19:57:44 <Camail> i've declined to dig too deep into that
19:58:09 <Dot`> lol
19:58:25 <Camail> dot you might like doing a curse build, it's supporty and does damage
20:00:07 <Camail> you could go real big on the memes and put as many curses as possible
20:00:29 <Camail> i was able to comfortably do 4 and keep all my stats and resists up, but maybe you could get another in, who knows

20:03:38 <Camail> it's hard because parties aren't really a thing people think about
20:07:14 <Camail> skram might like a chieftan tectonic slam build
20:08:24 <Camail> only issue there is that it uses a newly released asc keystone so i dont think there are any established builds
20:08:26 <skram> how similar is it to a barbarian
20:08:43 <Camail> piggy backing off an existing one would work for a more experienced player but we babbies
20:08:54 <Camail> well, it's melee
20:09:05 <Camail> and you are tanky as fuck
20:09:19 <skram> sold
20:09:20 <Camail> because you have a bunch of endurance charges
20:09:36 <skram> do i need to be angry to play
20:10:02 <Camail> it's an options
20:10:13 <Camail> it doesnt use the rage mechanic that berserker has
20:10:22 <Runbunny> skram, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZN_4bPZkgU
20:10:22 <Camail> but we literally dont know what it will be yet

20:13:28 <Runbunny> Have a look as well Camail.
20:17:14 <Camail> that seems like a fun awful build
20:22:24 <Runbunny> poe meme builds are the best.
