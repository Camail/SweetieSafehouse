16:06:32 <skraam> its a good cat
16:06:54 <Dot`> i had to work today
16:07:14 <skraam> well are you doing anything exciting at work
16:07:36 <Dot`> getting close to finishing programming Dronfield
16:08:03 <Dot`> it should be near ready when i leave to australia and the other guy has to show it to the client
16:08:23 <skraam> whats a dronfield
16:08:33 <Dot`> its a place in england
16:08:39 <Dot`> getting a new water treatment plant
16:08:46 <skraam> oooh yeah
16:08:48 <Dot`> its where the RAS/SAS is
16:08:58 <skraam> i remember
16:09:02 <skraam> pump controls and stuff
16:09:27 <Dot`> today i worked on the Polymer handling/mixing stuff
16:09:43 <skraam> like flocculation tanks on stuff?
16:09:55 <skraam> are you doing fancy PID things or just boring old digital level controls
16:10:05 <Dot`> i have done a few PID's now
16:10:52 <skraam> VFDs too?
16:11:20 <Dot`> VSD's?
16:11:32 <Dot`> whats the F stand for?
16:11:34 <skraam> variable frequency drives
16:11:50 <skraam> its the same thing i guess
16:11:56 <Dot`> we only have fixed speed and variable speed
16:12:02 <Dot`> i tihnk it would be
16:12:14 <Dot`> yea, they are what gets controlled by PID's
16:12:23 <skraam> well you modulate speed in asynchronous motors by frequency
16:12:32 <Dot`> also did some bellmouths that changed position regulate flow
16:13:26 <skraam> how does that work
16:14:25 <Dot`> there where 3 of them with various modes and they normaly would raise and lower to get a combined flow between them of what the operator requested
16:15:03 <skraam> but how does a bellmouth regulate flow
16:15:08 -!- Cane changed the topic of #tlponies to: It's not new year any more, maybe I should change this
16:15:11 <Dot`> it goes up and down
16:15:21 <skraam> hmm
16:15:42 <Dot`> the more its up, the more open it is, the more water an flow
16:16:08 <Dot`> its like a V cap in a slightly larger V
16:16:15 <Dot`> and you rasie the cap slowly
16:16:21 <skraam> isnt that just a valve

16:21:39 <Dot`> i have no idea skram, when i get to go to site i hope to find out
16:21:46 <Dot`> no one tells us these things
16:22:04 <Dot`> all we get is I/O and what they want it to do
16:22:18 <skraam> fair enough
16:22:26 <skraam> what sort of signal are you putting out to control it though
16:22:52 <skraam> or is it just a bit for each position
16:22:57 <Dot`> a 2- 14 mV pulse i tihnk
16:23:15 <skraam> thats a weird ass signal, pal
16:23:25 <Dot`> its so it can tell is it Out of Range
16:23:38 <Dot`> therefore borked
16:24:03 <skraam> well yeah, thats why everything uses 4-20 mA
16:24:10 <Dot`> maybe its that
16:24:17 <Dot`> i got the numbers mixed
16:24:22 <skraam> D:
16:24:27 <Dot`> i havnt looked at them in about 6 months
16:24:44 <Dot`> i just tell the PLC the position and it has a card that generates the signal
16:24:57 <skraam> how modern
16:25:15 <skraam> back in my day we'd have to do math ourselves to figure out what the numbers mean, mason!
16:25:32 <Dot`> now you just have an analogue block that you put in the scaling
16:25:51 <skraam> lazy youths
16:26:31 <Dot`> your just jelous
16:27:08 <skraam> you'll value my expertise if you ever have to program a 30 year old siemens plc
16:28:01 <Dot`> ill keep that in mind if i get asked to do an asset replacement
16:29:08 <skraam> Im sure you can just auto-generate new programs directly tbh
16:29:34 <Dot`> its suprising how unautomated most of what we do it
16:29:45 <Dot`> for a company that automates things 
16:30:10 <skraam> hmm
16:30:25 <skraam> all plc languages are standardized so it should be no big

18:00:50 <Zounds> muh Runbunny
18:01:16 <Runbunny> Zounds!
18:01:16 <Zounds> what u defending
18:01:16 <Runbunny> My thesis.
18:01:16 <Dot`> thats great runbun!
18:01:27 <Zounds> get a moat
18:01:55 <Runbunny> a moat with poison.
18:02:01 <skraam> is thesis defense different than castle defense
18:02:33 <Runbunny> A bit I think. But I think the overall experience is rather similar.
18:02:57 <skraam> can i call you doctor if you win it
18:03:29 <Runbunny> Nope. It's only a masters thesis.
18:03:53 <Runbunny> However officially, I'll be a "Master of Science"
18:03:55 <Dot`> Master Runbun
18:04:12 <skraam> dr master runbun
18:05:15 <Zounds> sifu runbun
18:05:45 <Runbunny> What a nightmare it has been though.
18:06:01 <Runbunny> I hope I get my life together in case of someone offering me a Ph.D
18:06:47 <skraam> i think having your shit together is mostly a myth
18:08:09 <Runbunny> I guess.
18:10:42 <Camail> oh also Runbunny  fucking RIP my build, gotta start over with the new tree
18:11:03 <Runbunny> Tree was changed a lot?
18:11:08 <Camail> i'm cool with it tho, the passives were less interesting to think about than skill gems
18:11:20 <Camail> the patch notes say the melee side was reworked heavily
18:11:41 <Camail> and if nothing else, in one of the gem spoilers i can see the fire pen nodes aren't in the same place
18:12:16 <Runbunny> Oh.
18:13:28 <Camail> have you read the patch notes yet
18:15:21 <Camail> occultist and elementalist got deleted
18:15:31 <Dot`> rip
18:15:43 <Camail> which is fine, i got 7k ES waaaaay too easily on occultist
18:15:51 <Camail> also bane was nerfed dot
18:16:09 <Camail> so the build i linked you is hella dead
18:16:17 <Camail> because its occultist CI bane
18:16:22 <Camail> all of which were seriously nerfed
18:17:01 <Dot`> so there should be some builds up in a few hours to start looking at to get ideas i guess
18:17:27 <Runbunny> I haven't O:
18:18:18 <Camail> basically all of the top tiers were nerfed and melee was buffed
18:18:32 <Camail> the right side classes were untouched
18:18:38 <Camail> other than trickster
18:19:15 <Camail> you could try tornado shot
18:19:37 <Camail> honestly you can do a multi curse bane build
18:19:55 <Camail> but like, 3 curses
18:20:03 <Dot`> is there a bubble wizard?
18:20:37 <Camail> what is that
18:20:57 <Dot`> the D3 build form ages ago where you caste 2 bubbles and used freezing orb
18:23:00 <Runbunny> Where is the patch notes though?
18:23:15 <Runbunny> Where they leaked?
18:23:24 <Camail> https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2512662
18:23:33 <Camail> manifesto, i guess
18:23:54 <Camail> it's not an itemized patch notes
18:24:12 <Runbunny> oh
18:24:29 <Runbunny> I'll wait for actual patch notes
18:24:39 <Runbunny> They are technically out but not really.
18:25:01 <Runbunny> https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/bwg4w8/what_happens_when_you_let_an_algorithm_write_the/
18:25:12 <Runbunny> These are the actual patch notes, scrambled.
18:25:14 <Camail> yea i saw that, meele skills doing damage is OP
18:25:40 <Camail> it's not scrambles it's a markov chain, which is amazing
18:25:44 <Dot`> im not sure about this change runbun, they should revert
18:25:46 <Dot`> -You'll now encounter monsters, which grant items and experience when slain.
18:25:52 <skraam> oh no
18:26:09 <Runbunny> Yes it sounds a bit game breaking.
18:34:25 <Rawr|Phone> 🐴🐴🐴
18:35:46 <Camail> also runbun i didnt realize your old stash tabs would be transferred like they are
18:35:59 <Camail> i spent a decent chunk of time spring cleaning for nothing >_>
18:36:07 <Runbunny> ;D
18:36:22 <Runbunny> You just get them as extra tabs in Standard.
18:36:38 <Camail> yea i'm super glad that's how it works
18:42:33 <Runbunny> .tell reification https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/3527184
18:42:35 <Camail> Runbunny  how often do stash tabs go on sale
18:42:52 <Camail> cuz i just realized that i have steam wallet bucks that i haven't used yet
18:42:58 <Runbunny> Pretty often.
18:43:20 <Runbunny> once a month maybe?
18:43:32 <Runbunny> Aren't they on sale now?
18:43:37 <Camail> i just need one premiuim tab, a map tab, a currency tab, and if i have osme left over a fragment tab
18:43:42 <Camail> ummm, i dont think so
18:44:01 <Camail> it doesnt say sale
18:44:23 <Camail> i'd prefer not to spend $15 on a map tab
18:44:32 <Camail> it is insanely useful tho
18:44:53 <Runbunny> I agree. There was no map tab when I got mine. 
18:45:11 <Runbunny> So I only have 2 premium tabs and currency tab.
18:46:09 <Camail> currency saves a ton of space, premiuim is basically an infinite whole for valuable items, and maps basically stack
18:46:19 <Camail> it would solve all my problems
