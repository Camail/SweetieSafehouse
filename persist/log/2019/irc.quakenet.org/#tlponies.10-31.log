23:10:46 <Rawr|Fone> Being an adult seems tough
23:15:37 <Crisium> it is :(
23:21:15 <skrm> ah its not so bad
23:23:17 <Rawr|Fone> At least you will be able to afford some lego skrm
23:23:54 <Camail> and he's learning how to hunt mons
23:23:59 <skrm> heck yeah
23:24:13 <Camail> make a mon out of lego
23:24:16 <Camail> then smash it
23:24:23 <Camail> and wear the lego jawbone as a hairpin
23:24:31 <skrm> are mooses considered mons
23:24:50 <Camail> they are very big and deadly
23:24:54 <Camail> and immune to some elements
23:24:57 <Camail> sounds like a mon
23:25:01 <Runbunny> And they're mad.
23:25:14 <Camail> though i dont think your irl hunter rank is high enough for that mission
23:25:24 <Camail> you gotta start off small
23:25:37 <Camail> kill rats with your hands, make a rat knife
23:25:44 <Camail> then work up from there
23:25:59 <Camail> shooting an sos flare works differently tho
23:26:07 <Camail> the other players are just angry
23:26:09 <skrm> well ive been on a meese hunt
23:26:15 <Runbunny> Mine some iron and make a horn.
23:26:21 <skrm> its mostly about shooting at things your dog is hunting
23:26:28 <skrm> so sorta like being carried in mon hun i guess
