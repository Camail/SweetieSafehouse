00:00:55 <Runbunny> Beta max and laser disc.
00:01:54 <skram> betamax is pretty doable with homebrew gear, but laserdisc requires proper industrial equipment so probably not
00:03:04 <skram> or
00:03:06 <skram> hmm
00:03:22 <skram> laserdiscs are basically just 12" CDs afaik
00:03:27 <DuB`> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtl1S0kUMEw
00:03:35 <skram> so you just need a big ass CD-R drive
00:05:43 <skram> I like the fluttery panning thing
00:05:49 <skram> Wow woW
00:06:58 <DuB`> 2:30 synths are bestest
00:32:43 <skram> DuB`: https://neoncityrecords.bandcamp.com/album/neoncity-cruise

00:37:27 <DuB`> Yes this is a good
00:38:58 <Runbunny> I'll go sleep
