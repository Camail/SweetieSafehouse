17:08:56 <Rawr|Fone> It's evening dub
17:09:39 <DuB`> The world is round, my dear
17:10:06 <Rawr|Fone> Definitely not
17:10:23 <Rawr|Fone> If so, everyone would fall off

17:15:57 <Camail> dub where are you in dos2?
17:16:19 <Camail> also whose your main
17:19:20 <DuB`> Near end of act 2
17:19:51 <DuB`> Shadowblade sebille with a whole team of buffers/mages :P
17:20:16 <Camail> ahhh, so you play elf juri instead of romancing her
17:20:22 <Camail> makes sense
17:20:23 <DuB`> Ya ya
17:20:50 <Camail> her story arc is cool
17:21:01 <Camail> i still like lohse's the most, but i'm biased

17:22:59 <Camail> do you have elemental synergies down yet dub
17:23:09 <DuB`> Like wha
17:23:23 <DuB`> I just set literally everything on fire
17:23:24 <Camail> water and lightning
17:23:29 <Camail> earth and fire
17:23:33 <DuB`> And maybe some poison for fun
17:24:11 <Camail> i never got much into poison cuz there are enough undead to make it inconsistent 
17:24:27 <DuB`> Fire EVERYTHING
17:24:32 <Camail> of course
17:24:51 <Dot> its dubs way
17:25:06 <Camail> my second run (after my first run bugged out BIG TIME) used exclusivle water/ice/lightning
17:25:16 <Camail> and that elementalist perk
17:25:32 <Camail> w/e its called, the one where you use less ap for the thing you're standing in
17:25:40 <Camail> so you can cast 4 spells a turn
17:25:55 <DuB`> I'd love to try like 4x mages with ice king and elementalist :P
17:26:13 <Runbunny> Rawr|Fone, I have clear skies and sun.
17:26:47 <Camail> well you can respec at any point
17:27:03 <Camail> it ruins your portrait tho, for some reason
17:27:12 <DuB`> Doing that much sounds like a lot of work hha
17:27:14 <Rawr|Fone> Same for me now runbun
17:29:54 <DuB`> I hope you've all seen the dog course shrek gif
17:30:00 <DuB`> It's the best the internet has to offer today
