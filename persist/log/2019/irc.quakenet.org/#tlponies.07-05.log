06:50:47 <DuB`> Read in once back in like 2012 and couldn't stand how Mary Sue the mc was, but I believe I'm a bit numbed to that now having read as much manga as I have :P
06:50:50 <DoT|Phone> Nice book
06:50:53 <DuB`> Read it*
06:51:00 <DoT|Phone> besides that
06:51:56 <DoT|Phone> have you read alloy of law yet though?
06:52:26 <DuB`> Can't remember
06:52:31 <DuB`> Um um
06:52:43 <DuB`> Nope
06:52:57 <DoT|Phone> you should. it's great
06:53:14 <DoT|Phone> you read mistborn right?
06:54:40 <DuB`> Ya
06:57:03 <DoT|Phone> ok. it's not essential but alloy of law takes place after so having read mistborn helps place things
06:58:06 <DoT|Phone> I would put alloy of law as one of my favourites
07:01:33 <DoT|Phone> Rawr. more tourney today?

07:32:19 <Runbunny> I recently read "name of the wind". Like I was done with the second book a few days ago.
07:33:17 <Runbunny> MC is pretty Mary Sue, but I mostly attribute it to the fact that it's a story he tells about himself. So ofc he's going to appear better than he really is.
07:35:32 <DuB`> Ya troo
07:39:39 <Runbunny> but yeah he is pretty much the luckiest motherfucker in the world. 
07:39:49 <Runbunny> And amazingly stupid at times.
08:36:50 <DuB`> Whoops
