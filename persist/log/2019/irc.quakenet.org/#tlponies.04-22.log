19:46:07 <Runbunny> A little something to keep you entertained.
19:46:41 <Runbunny> You ask them a question that will catch them off guard. Something they don't expect.
19:49:11 <Camail> runbun i'm not gonna ask them about their waifu
19:49:21 <Camail> i think i would be blackballed
19:50:08 <Runbunny> Don't ask me stuff, ask the people stuff.
