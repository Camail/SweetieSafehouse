00:07:39 <Runbunny> Have you tried the other one?
00:07:46 <Runbunny> Scourge arrow or whatever.
00:24:07 <Camail> yea i have a scourge arrow ranger, it's fine
00:24:14 <Camail> i dont like spore pods in general
00:25:03 <Camail> caustic arrow is nice
00:25:22 <Camail> once i get to lvl 36-38 elemental arrow has felt really good
00:27:19 <Camail> i have something for 1-11 and 36-maps, there's that weird area of 12-35 where i'm not 100% sure what to do
00:35:15 <Runbunny> Soo carcinisation, I am compiling the list.
00:35:33 <Runbunny> There's a lot of posts.
00:35:41 <carcinisation> :O
00:37:48 <carcinisation> i shall look forward to it
00:38:19 <Runbunny> You can consider it an early christmas preset or something.

07:08:22 <skrm> heck yeh
07:08:34 <DuB`> :o
07:08:41 <skrm> its finally winter
07:08:49 <DuB`> wew
07:08:54 <Camail> dub how has the weekend been
07:08:59 <Camail> you have TWO more days of it
07:10:27 <DuB`> I sat here and played games :D
07:15:01 <DuB`> Might go out and do some shopping 'n see if I can't find christmas presents for family tomoro
07:19:56 <Rawr|Fone> It is bed time dub
07:20:14 <Camail> party time*
07:21:06 <DuB`> Partyyyyyyyyy
07:21:24 <Rawr|Fone> ü§®ü§®ü§®
07:22:15 <DuB`> I got the HBG I've been hunting from my first Kulve run last night
07:22:24 <DuB`> I can 2-shot low rank great jagras now lolol
07:23:22 <Camail> hbg is like, from a different game
07:23:29 <Camail> i dont know what game, but certainly not monhun
07:23:51 <DuB`> Pretty awkward to use
07:24:40 <DuB`> But carrying a whole inventory of craftables for tons of para/sleep/exhuast in a group is mad OP
07:26:06 <Camail> yea, the meta is support bow if you wanna status lock the bigger boys
07:27:22 <Camail> but having a support player who knows the fights makes the game insanely easy
07:27:35 <Camail> planned fights are an entirely different style
07:28:22 <DuB`> Gonna try to support everyone throught some ATKT as soon as they're all back from thanksgiving-ing
07:29:12 <DuB`> But man
07:29:35 <DuB`> Running AT Xeno enough times to get the parts for that bowgun set was by far the hardest thing I've done in mhw
07:30:08 <DuB`> Brutal and long fight, ran up within minutes of the time limit every time even after going to the trouble of finding decent groups in a discord server
07:32:30 <Camail> next up is extremoth
07:32:43 <DuB`> Ack
07:33:41 <skrm> EXTREMOTH
07:33:51 <DuB`> I'll just tell myself that I've been wearing drachen stuff too long anyway, getting the layered set is no incentive :P
07:33:52 <skrm> is it a really big moth or an extreme behemoth
07:33:56 <Camail> do you use hands/legs/pants from xeno gamma?
07:34:00 <DuB`> Ya
07:34:18 <Camail> makes sense
07:34:34 <Camail> but you love flinch free so much
07:34:36 <Camail> obv get the chest
07:35:01 <DuB`> blehh
07:35:37 <Camail> lul
07:36:11 <DuB`> That fight would be okay if the entire arena floor wasn't lava 90% of the time
07:36:42 <Camail> even when running fire res decos and health augment?
07:37:14 <DuB`> And fireproof mantle
07:37:17 <Camail> mechanically that seems similar to at val hazak
07:38:12 <Camail> health booster might be relevant
07:45:32 <Rawr|Fone> üò¥üò¥üò¥
07:50:45 <DuB`> I'm something like 70/30 between deciding on charge blade / longsword to main in iceborne...
07:50:48 <DuB`> Both so fun
