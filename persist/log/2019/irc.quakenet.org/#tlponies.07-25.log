17:47:04 <skram> what did you put on em
17:50:20 <Zounds> oven potatoes? :O
17:50:37 <Zounds> that could mean a few things, all of 'em good
17:51:42 <skram> I assumed it was baked potato
17:51:52 <skram> but it could be oven roasted too i guess
17:52:43 <Zounds> I'm eating potato right now
17:52:47 <Zounds> of the mashed variety
17:53:05 <Zounds> breaded chicken steak, mash and peas
17:53:16 <Zounds> though tiny portions because i'm too warm to eat
17:53:32 <Runbunny> I didn't even do anything. I just put 'em in the oven.
17:53:38 <skram> potato is pretty great in any shape except boiled i think
17:53:51 <Zounds> boiled baby potato with some butter on 'em tho
17:53:54 <Zounds> shits so good

17:54:46 <Runbunny> and ramoulade ofc.
17:55:03 <skram> hmm
17:55:12 <Zounds> never had 'em with fish but I'd be for it
17:55:21 <skram> i had some fried salmon with the home made kimchi
17:55:23 <skram> was pretty good
17:55:26 <Zounds> actually that's a lie i totally have

17:56:08 <Runbunny> Yes.
17:56:13 <Runbunny> however.
17:56:18 <skram> well yes but i dont think it exists in norwegen
17:56:20 <Runbunny> Asparagus potatoes.
17:56:25 <Runbunny> They are the stuiff
17:57:38 <skram> doubt
18:03:26 <Runbunny> Apparently they are called "ratte potato" in english.
18:05:38 <Zounds> ooh
18:05:43 <Zounds> not sure I've ever eaten one
18:10:36 <Runbunny> It's like a portato but a bit different taste.
