00:06:59 <Camail> twitch made some tweaks to theater mode, nice little convenience features
00:08:15 <Camail> with bttv to hide all the advertising garbage, the actual functionality decisions of twitch have consistently been really good
00:29:16 <Runbunny> ublock origin currently still works for twitch, or maybe the streams I watch just doesn't do commercials.
00:30:25 <Camail> no not the ads on stream, stuff like advertised channels and whispers and the prime bell
00:30:52 <Camail> all the stuff that has nothing to do with the stream i am currently watching, i hide it all
00:31:08 <Camail> but i've actually stopped hiding twitch extensions because some are pretty useful
00:31:26 <Camail> the poe one is quite nice, as navigating poe profiles is metaphorical cancer
00:33:37 <Runbunny> lel
00:33:54 <Runbunny> The magic the gathering one is pretty neat as well.
00:34:35 <Runbunny> I don't really look at recommended channels and nobody whispers me so that's all great.
00:34:40 <Camail> yea, but when i do watch it's typically not arena so i dont get much out of it
00:35:23 <Runbunny> Yeh I guess.
00:37:07 <Camail> eh, it's all clutter
00:37:12 <Camail> i'd rather it not be there if i dont use it
00:37:37 <Camail> so that i can let my eyes wander and only see things i care about
