17:21:53 <Camail> darb
17:22:02 <CockRoach|42> happy late dub-day, DuB`!
17:22:05 <DuB`> In the hour after you got off I may have stumbled into the fastest build in all of dablo
17:22:09 <CockRoach|42> sorry i forgot :(
17:22:12 <Camail> that's quite fast
17:22:14 <Camail> maybe too fast
17:22:21 <DuB`> Like 3x faster than any speed build I've ever played lol
17:22:26 <DuB`> Thanks CR!
17:23:05 <Camail> go grind for ancients
17:23:55 <Camail> i think i might be done for now
17:24:31 <Camail> the future looks grim,the one potentially cool thing is using ancients and wow do i not want to grind
17:24:54 <Camail> levelling with the lightning build was really fun tho
17:25:24 <DuB`> But GALAXY WINGS :P
17:26:44 <Camail> yea but i dont like firebird =/
17:26:56 <Camail> archon's apparently the best set atm
17:27:26 <Camail> i'm sure people are grinding out to get ancients so the leaderboards arent using the best gear yet
