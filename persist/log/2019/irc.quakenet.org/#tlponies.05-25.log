21:27:25 <Rawr|Fone> It's almost bed time
21:29:08 <skrm> yes, only 8 hours left
21:29:24 <Runbunny> Jonas, it was in reference to Bunny girl-senpai. 
21:29:55 <skrm> do you ever dream of bunny girl senpai, anders?
21:30:55 <Runbunny> I very rarely recall my dreams. Which is probably for the best.
21:31:57 <skrm> hm
21:31:59 <skrm> fair enough
21:32:01 <Runbunny> I usually just go lay down on my bed, close my eyes disregarding the tears and I awake some time later.
21:34:39 <skrm> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfrBobsarhM
21:36:30 <Runbunny> I was suspecting a scream, not gonna lie.
21:39:41 <skrm> i watched eromanga sensei here the other day, runbun
21:39:43 <skrm> it was
21:39:44 <skrm> a thing
21:40:01 <skrm> ill never be pure again

21:50:42 <Runbunny> Why?
21:51:01 <Runbunny> Jonas, please stir away from the trash.
21:51:06 <Runbunny> Watch Golden Boy.
21:52:27 <skrm> well its like nietzsche said
21:52:54 <skrm> if you gaze long enough into an abyss etc
21:53:03 <skrm> no runbun i vow to only watch trash

21:53:59 <skrm> domestic girlfriends next
21:53:59 <Runbunny> Should be right up your alley.
21:54:06 <reification> i'm surprised he didn't go for oreimo if he wanted the real trash
21:54:15 <skrm> love triangle but they're both his sisters? sounds like the epitome of trash
21:54:32 <Runbunny> well they're not related.
21:54:42 <Runbunny> But one is his teacher.
