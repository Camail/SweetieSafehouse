23:37:23 <Camail> hatoful is a very interesting game
23:37:26 <Camail> i didnt play it tho
23:37:46 <Camail> and its more of a visual novel than a dating sim once you get to the good parts
23:37:56 <Camail> but i also dont play VNs
23:42:33 <skrm> is that the one with pidgeons
23:44:32 <Camail> ya
23:44:40 <Camail> birds of all sorts
23:47:16 <skrm> wonderful
23:47:22 <skrm> did you do DDLC
23:48:24 <Dot`> skrm, you have any real thoughts what your going to do in dnd?
23:48:55 <Camail> i've watched ddlc
23:50:31 <skrm> Its pretty great but doesnt have any replayability i guess
23:50:39 <skrm> not yet dot, im gonna have to talk to dub
23:50:44 <Camail> ddlc is ruined by its fanbase, but none the less it's a good meta game
23:51:15 <Camail> it's a lot of peoples first exposure to self referential games, which is cool
23:53:14 <skrm> whats wrong with the fanbase?
23:59:03 <carcinisation> oh boy an eliminations medal mercy victory
