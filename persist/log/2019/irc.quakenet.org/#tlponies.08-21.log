18:09:15 <Camail> might be legit
18:09:23 <Camail> legit as in not a virus
18:09:30 <Camail> but again, not sure
18:10:27 <skrma> i thought kat was killed
18:10:35 <DoT`> it was at one point
18:10:38 <Camail> yea but theres copy cats and stuff
18:10:46 <Camail> the real kat is dead
18:11:02 <Camail> but i get my games from a copy cat site so it doesn't even matter at this point
18:11:15 <DoT`> also, no skram, i dont know any prefred 2d drawing programs
18:11:27 <Camail> as long as the host isn't fucking with you

18:12:35 <skrma> im just gonna try this freecad thing first
18:12:50 <Camail> yea makes sense
18:13:59 <skrma> Im just trying to make a drawing for some fab work im doing, thought it might be easier in 2d since i have no experience doing 3d modeling at all
18:14:46 <Camail> use crayons
18:21:16 <skrma> honestly that seems easier
18:27:34 <DuB|fon> Do your fab in pink crayon for extra fab

21:03:52 <Rawr|Phone> Thank you reef reef ‚ù§
21:04:54 <DoT`> rawr <3
21:05:07 <Rawr|Phone> DoT DoT DoT
21:05:45 <Rawr|Phone> Wonderful news dot, I am playing a tournament next week where I have the chance to get crushed by the swedish national team
21:07:57 <DoT`> !!!
21:07:58 <DoT`> or
21:08:10 <DoT`> i believe you can do admiribly
21:08:55 <skram> this is the start of a underdog movie, rawr
21:09:33 <Rawr|Phone> Well, I'd have to get through the group stage first I guess
21:09:59 <DoT`> you got this rawr <3
21:10:06 <Rawr|Phone> But all the national team players are using this tournament as a warm up before the european team championships
21:10:21 <Rawr|Phone> So suddenly everyone wanted to play 
21:10:29 <skram> they're gonna be real surprised when you kick their asses
21:14:20 <Rawr|Phone> That would definitely be a surprise
21:14:56 <reification> https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7374353/German-funfair-shuts-new-ride-realising-looks-like-Swastika.html
21:16:18 <BioPone> If you beat one then you can be on the team right?
21:17:04 <skram> nah if you beat them he'll be the next king of sweden
21:18:18 <DoT`> you have to beat all 4 in 1 go, just like the elite 4 in pokemon
21:18:27 <DoT`> im pretty sure thats what you have been traning for rawr
21:18:41 <Runbunny> Nah Camail. I played around a bit and then I lost interest :/
21:18:54 <Camail> aww
21:19:28 <Rawr|Phone> Sure dot
21:19:32 <Rawr|Phone> Probably
21:20:06 <Camail> are you gonna play blight runbun? or gonna take a league break
21:20:26 <Camail> there's a decent number of people waiting for 4.0
21:21:13 <Camail> i might skip this league, its fun but i dunno
21:21:20 <Runbunny> I'll probably play.
21:21:21 <Camail> maybe if there's a really weird build
21:21:23 <Runbunny> I am not sure though
21:21:35 <Runbunny> Depends a lot on how wow classic is unfolding.
21:21:58 <Camail> well it'll last at least as long as the 3 months 3.8 will run for
21:24:25 <Runbunny> I guess, but will my friends last? Will I last?
21:24:33 <Runbunny> What is even the meaning of all this?

21:39:27 <DoT`> Runbun, who is best warhammer 40k race?
21:43:02 <Runbunny> Hmmm.
21:43:26 <Runbunny> That's a tough one Dot.
21:43:52 <DoT`> you need help? https://i.imgur.com/T01oPrH.jpg
21:43:59 <DoT`> (though its Eldar)
21:44:00 <Cane> Orcs. Their ships fly faster because they're red.
21:44:14 <Runbunny> It's chaos.
21:44:25 <DoT`> Chaos is litrly the worst
21:44:36 <Runbunny> No no. Think about it.
21:44:40 <DoT`> and nurgle the worst of them!
21:44:58 <Runbunny> How are you going to meet fine ladies, like the one you linked?
21:45:00 <Runbunny> Chaos.
21:45:16 <Camail> runbun is a slaanesh cultist
21:45:19 <Camail> isn't it obvious
21:45:27 <DoT`> there are always tyranids, necrons, orks
21:45:28 <Camail> he can no longer find joy in simple experiences
21:45:44 <Camail> its must be because he needs to find new ones, like rending flesh
21:45:44 <Runbunny> There is no longer joy.
21:45:53 <Camail> joy is a chase
21:46:27 <DoT`> anime is heresy and runbun likes anime
21:46:33 <DoT`> cam has a good point
21:46:52 <Camail> anime is degeneracy, classic slaanesh
21:47:23 <Camail> look, i've made a rimworld colony named after him/her, i'm not innocent in this
21:47:33 <Camail> many war crimes
21:47:53 <Camail> we had organ day, it was a profitable day
21:48:13 <DoT`> did the children sing and chher on this day?
21:48:19 <DoT`> and dance in the blood
21:48:54 <skram> which is the one that needs skulls for the skull throne
21:48:57 <Camail> they were pretty bummed, sadly
21:49:04 <Camail> thats why you do it all on one day
21:49:11 <Camail> you can only get so sad from organ harvesting
21:50:57 <DoT`> Khorne skram
21:51:15 <DoT`> blood for the blood god, and skulls for the skull throne
21:51:28 <DoT`> his skull throne*
21:51:38 <Runbunny> Now you're talking Dot.
21:51:42 <Runbunny> I knew you had it in you.
21:52:01 <DoT`> i played orks and eldar
21:52:03 <skram> sounds like a swell guy
21:52:06 <Runbunny> Also dark eldar are just edgy eldar right?
21:52:06 <skram> how do i join his cult
21:52:18 <DoT`> prancy space elves and green hooligans
21:52:40 <Phearlock> Tyranids are the cutest so I'd go with them
21:52:50 <DoT`> that they are phear
21:52:51 <Phearlock> They're not edgy they're just hungry
21:52:57 <Phearlock> adorable
21:53:08 <skram> eldar had the best towers in the WH40K TD in wc3
21:54:13 <DoT`> Tau battlesuites are probably still one of my favourite thingsg
21:54:22 <Runbunny> Anyhoo
21:54:29 <Runbunny> I gotta go sleep
21:54:31 <DoT`> gnight bun
21:54:42 <DoT`> im an hour late too to sleep again
21:54:47 <DoT`> gnight all
21:54:59 <Runbunny> So I can be a disappointment to society again tomorrow.
21:55:14 <DoT`> you never dissapoint me runbun <3
