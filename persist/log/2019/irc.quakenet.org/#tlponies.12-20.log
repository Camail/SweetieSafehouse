19:06:38 <Dot`> ive been packing for move tomorow
19:11:01 <skrm> is it far
19:12:07 <Dot`> about 5 minutes walk
19:15:19 <skrm> are you gonna carry all your stuff?
19:16:06 <Dot`> no, i hired ppl to do that for me
19:16:20 <Dot`> im not carrying a washing machine down 2 flights of stairs
19:16:25 <Dot`> or a fridge
19:16:31 <skrm> fair enough
19:17:09 <Dot`> plus i got no friends in north england to help me move, so its just me
19:20:12 <skrm> isnt scotland in north england
19:20:45 <Dot`> dont let zounds hear you say that
19:26:11 <Micen_> good morning. 
19:26:32 <Dot`> hey micen
19:27:27 <skrm> micen my fren
19:27:33 <skrm> how is chrimmas coming along
19:27:54 <Dot`> probably been cooking for a week already
19:28:49 <Micen_> no. 
19:28:50 <Micen_> no oven 
19:29:56 <Dot`> building an old school mud oven as we speak?
19:30:06 <Dot`> from that youtube channel guy
19:30:20 <Micen_> our oven broke before Thanksgiving and we had to use a small countertop thing. so the new oven finally comes in yesterday it only just fits in the cutout because its a wall oven. And the new one doesnt have a long enough line to reach the house's power. 
19:31:17 <skrm> :(
19:31:25 <Micen_> and no money in the house right now due to Christmas so no proper size oven until after the holidays. 
19:32:13 <Micen_> no money to hire an electrician to install a juncture box (because the house was built and wired before that was required) and extend the house's power line up like a foot and a half. 
19:32:34 <Dot`> extensio lead
19:32:41 <Dot`> (i have no idea how ovens are fitted)
19:33:16 <Micen_> small gap behind it that the cable runs down power is coming up out of the floor. 
19:33:58 <Micen_> but the wiring in this house is strange and old. so we want someone insured to do this just in case something screws up they cover it instead of us eating the cost. 
19:37:27 <skrm> how old is your house micen
19:40:03 <Micen_> ~50

19:40:35 <Micen_> built by the owners before us. 
19:40:55 <Micen_> and I mean they built it. not that they hired a contractor to build it.

19:45:19 <skrm> DIY electrical wiring?
19:45:38 <Micen_> basically. 
19:45:54 <skrm> thats a big oof
19:46:14 <Micen_> theres a plug we cant use because using it knocks power out for a wall of the house.  
19:46:24 <Micen_> also we have wall carpeting. 
19:46:58 <Micen_> like carpeting on walls as an accent thing. 
19:47:10 <Micen_> floor to ceiling carpeting.
19:48:44 <skrm> carpets are the worst thing, micen
19:48:54 <Micen_> they are. 
19:49:00 <Micen_> the master bedroom has shag.
19:49:22 <Micen_> glued stapled and nailed in. 
19:49:35 <Micen_> they didnt want it going anywhere
19:49:35 <skrm> rip it up, micen
19:50:26 <Micen_> i dont have the money, time free of back pain or ability to clear the stuff to remove carpeting. 
19:50:50 <skrm> ill bring me a big ass hammer next time i drop by alright
19:53:24 <Micen_> ill still be missing money to get new flooring to cover the subflooring but you are welcome any time. 
19:56:29 <skrm> if you're real lucky there might be hardwoord underneath
19:56:35 <Micen_> there isnt. 
19:56:49 <Micen_> we pulled up a little bit. 
19:56:58 <Micen_> a long time ago. 
19:57:17 <Micen_> and the linoleum in the kitchen got worn out in a spot. 
19:57:31 <skrm> aww
19:59:11 <Dot|Phone>  skram just needs to bring his dad, he builds wood things
