19:56:46 <skram> ooh
19:56:57 <skram> i thought you had started playing overwatch there for a second

20:32:23 <Phearlock> Yeah Mechwarrior 5 ended up being epic exclusive too <.<
20:32:43 <skram> wait i thought it was supposed to be 6 months exclusive but its not coming until april 2020
20:32:54 <DoT`> the mech is called iron bear skram!
20:33:03 <DoT`> it WAS a 6 month... im sure of it
20:33:16 <skram> yeah
20:33:20 <DoT`> and phear, too many epic store exclusives
20:34:39 <skram> remember satisfactory?
20:34:56 <DoT`> oh yea, last i saw it got trains
20:35:12 <DoT`> is it epic too?
20:35:17 <skram> yep
20:35:20 <DoT`> :/
20:35:41 <skram> its in early access and everything
20:35:41 <DoT`> i know the new Metro as too
20:35:49 <DoT`> was too*
20:38:53 <DoT`> Guess i will just stick to Dorf fort
20:42:35 <DoT`> skram https://imgur.com/gallery/eIzyDgJ
20:42:39 <reification> safe choice dot
20:43:01 <skram> lol
20:44:13 <reification> it would be nice if steam would stop being twats about vns too
20:44:20 <skram> is the bit about internet true though?
20:44:34 <skram> running water sometimes but electricity is a luxury
20:45:05 <Phearlock> Honestly I'm not too upset about buying stuff off the epic store
20:45:34 <Phearlock> It's like, exclusivity thing is annoying, split friends list is annoying
20:46:01 <reification> i like all the free stuff
20:46:04 <Phearlock> But the "owned by china" thing is pretty overblown. Google already has all my data.
20:46:31 <Phearlock> And have probably sold it somewhere
20:46:48 <Phearlock> I hope they enjoy all the furry websites I visit
20:47:10 <skram> google things im in holland
20:47:11 <skram> its fine
20:47:16 <skram> thinks
20:47:20 <DoT`> phears data is prime stuff
20:47:24 <Phearlock> 200 IQ skram
20:47:41 <skram> i'd pay at least a dollar to have phearlocks data
20:48:06 <Phearlock> Buy me some SSD's and you can have my old drives
20:48:07 <reification> speaking of china it's time to watch communist propaganda
20:48:10 <DoT`> i ended up gettign a huwai laptop, china can have my data, im sure everyone else already has it
20:48:24 <DoT`> is that an anime reif?
20:49:15 <reification> well you remember the article about the facebook censors who ended up believing in conspiracies from doing their job
20:49:24 <DoT`> also reif, did you lose power at all earlier? there was apparently a large issue with the national grid
20:49:35 <reification> i'm imagining something like that for the guy going through phears data
20:49:39 <Phearlock> rofl
20:49:43 <DoT`> haha
20:49:51 <reification> there was dot but not here
20:49:55 <Phearlock> I'm 100% certain we landed on the moon though
20:50:00 <skram> phearlock's FBI agent is a furry now
20:50:04 <skram> are you proud of yourself
20:50:16 <Phearlock> I mean, yeah.
20:50:29 <skram> i would be too honestly
20:50:31 <DoT`> do you think they cycle phears FBI agents to try minimize the damage
20:50:34 <reification> actually dot it's some historical drama thingy
20:51:26 <Phearlock> I don't think they have enough agents for that
20:51:36 <Phearlock> Better to just sacrifice one guy
20:51:53 <DoT`> brave soul
20:54:01 <reification> relevant https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EBP-yVJUYAAozGk.png
20:54:18 <reification> also https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EBQGwEYWwAAxYCR.png
21:03:32 <DoT`> no word form dub if his mormon recalibration has gone well?

21:11:52 <skram> i didnt even know it needed recalibration dot
21:13:02 <DoT`> time in the big city can confuse ppl skram
21:13:52 <DoT`> skram, do you recall what was happening at all in our dnd game?
21:14:42 <skram> dnd game??
21:15:08 <DoT`> that makes it easy, i can delete your dorf
21:15:13 <skram> D:
21:15:38 <skram> last thing i remember is the esplosion and talkin to blackstaff
21:16:20 <DoT`> i think you forgot a whole session
21:23:02 <DoT`> you talked to so many ppl looking for that robit
21:23:47 <skram> yaya i remember
21:24:04 <skram> jonah had real difficulties differentiating the two places
21:25:06 <DoT`> HAHA

21:25:55 <skram> haha
21:26:01 <skram> did you ask him about that
21:26:39 <DoT`> nah, but the things he knew and tried to do where very suspicious
21:27:02 <DoT`> ill leave it and look for an oppertunity to punish him if it keeps occuring
21:27:19 <skram> scary
21:32:18 <skram> dot i wanna get a deep fryer but i dont think i excersize enough to own one
21:32:37 <DoT`> get a shallow frier to start?
21:33:02 <skram> haha
21:33:44 <DoT`> second option is to spend that money on lego, cheese and old records forst
21:33:47 <DoT`> first
21:33:54 <skram> hmm hmm
21:34:26 <skram> thats a better plan
