05:07:58 <DoT`> morning
05:08:19 <DoT`> hmm its 6 am
05:13:15 <DuB`> O dear
05:13:20 <DuB`> So early on a saturday!
05:14:04 <DoT`> dubs <3
05:18:09 <DuB`> I kind of want to start a stellaris but it's 11pm
05:19:31 <DoT`> you space boy
05:20:08 <DuB`> If I go to space now I won't sleep until late
05:20:13 <DuB`> And there's deendz tomoro
05:20:18 <DuB`> ... and packing
05:23:37 <DuB`> I have to move 2100 miles on sunday
05:26:41 <DoT`> well at least you dont have to walk
05:26:46 <DoT`> thats pretty far
05:26:53 <DuB`> Good point
05:28:26 <DuB`> Brother and mom are coming with to help set everything up (and mom didn't trust me to decorate etc on my own)
05:28:36 <DoT`> lol
05:28:45 <DuB`> Brother is looking forward to nyc trip but little does he know he's just gonna be the ikea-thing building slave
05:28:58 <DuB`> 'Cause there's a lot :P
05:29:13 <DoT`> silly little bro, he should have guessed
05:29:27 <DuB`> Actually, might not be that much. Just big stuff
05:30:43 <DuB`> OWL going very late tonight :O
05:30:52 <DuB`> And GENJI? What is going on
05:31:43 <DuB`> Dot I got GLASSES so I'm finally a real nerd now
05:31:59 <DoT`> wow
05:32:30 <DoT`> why now?
05:34:20 <DuB`> I'd noticed needing to sit further up in the classroom in just the last year, and hadn't had a checkup since like elementary school
05:34:50 <DuB`> I don't need them badly at all, just got some cheap ones to see how much the effect is
05:35:21 <DoT`> and so you can do the anime glasses thing?
05:35:28 <DuB`> Of course
05:35:52 <DuB`> I've got the slight-head-tilt-and-smirk down pat already
05:36:01 <DoT`> great
05:45:59 <DuB`> I sure do hope the utilities get turned on properly it's gonna be warm there...
05:53:34 <Camail> woo, my build is cruising
05:55:20 <DoT`> easy life?
05:57:10 <Camail> maybe, something clicked and i'm doing stupid damage
05:57:22 <Camail> unless the melee bugs happen and i stop being able to do any damage at all
05:57:31 <Camail> but then i run away like a coward
05:57:48 <DoT`> nice, very tactical

06:09:43 <Camail> dot i think i have a decent wand for you
06:10:13 <Camail> 100% increase spell damage and an open prefix for added cold damage
06:10:27 <Camail> and 5% non-chaos as extra chaos
06:11:54 <DoT`> put in stash pls. ill have a look
06:24:29 <DoT`> oh, agdq starts this weekend
06:29:43 <DoT`> when it says 77% increased spell damage, is that a global, or just the gems in it
06:31:33 <Camail> that's global dot
06:32:05 <Camail> the only local modifiers are thing that affect stats on the weapon
06:32:15 <DoT`> ah, ok
06:32:19 <Camail> like attack speed, crit chance, added damage
06:32:31 <Camail> you can see it explicitly says added damage to spells

12:59:43 <DoT`> rawr, skram hates cute things
13:00:37 <Rawr|Fone> Well he likes you so I don't think that's true
13:12:07 <DoT`> well he doesn tlike heynas and they are very cute
13:12:12 <DoT`> and they are cats
13:19:58 <Rawr|Fone> Skram is this true
13:25:20 <skram> Hyenas are not cute
13:26:05 <Rawr|Fone> I'd say you are correct
13:26:35 <DoT`> how could you both be so wrong
13:33:06 <Rawr|Fone> But dot you are the one who is wrong
13:33:46 <skram> I think its a survival method, henrik
13:34:11 <skram> hyenas are all over in africa and if you pretend they're cute you might just have enough courage to go outside
13:37:36 <Rawr|Fone> Good point
13:51:47 <DoT`> your all just afircan animal haters
13:52:10 <skram> there are many cute african animals, DoT`

19:31:37 <Camail> i think the commentators aren't properly putting the map into the narrative
19:32:08 <Camail> like, yes it's a comeback but 11-4 is considered kinda normal on nuke so 13-2 isn't as insane as it looks
19:32:27 <Camail> there's no "composure" change, it's literally which side they are on
19:33:21 <Camail> the fact that liquid even got 1 t round should have been a bigger deal to them
