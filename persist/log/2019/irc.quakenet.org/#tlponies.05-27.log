01:01:31 <Camail> hmmmm
01:02:00 <Camail> you cancel spells with movement skills, but cant chain cancel movement skills into themselves
01:02:11 <Camail> but maybe you can cancel a movement skill into a different movement skill
01:02:21 <Camail> that would be fascinating
01:02:43 <Camail> god this game just feels so authentic
01:06:58 <Camail> aw damn, there is a global cooldown, but only on "some" of them...maybe there is a way

17:54:54 <skram> The box was heavier than the cans though
17:55:06 <skram> hmmyes
17:55:31 <Camail> any time he links you a song just where them
17:55:34 <Camail> and maybe a scarf
17:55:39 <Camail> and a cardboard cutout of his face
17:55:42 <Camail> or his real face
17:56:02 <skram> i dont know how good they are though, but they're studio headphones for my abba dubstep remix projects

20:18:43 <Zounds> Sorry :(
20:19:11 <skram> Ill have that sweet sweet fiber internets in about a week hopefully
20:19:23 <Dot`> what are you up to skram with such limited tubes
20:19:56 <skram> i downloaded 300 gigs of deviancy before i left the old apt
20:20:17 <Dot`> oh wow
20:20:26 <Dot`> thats many deviations
20:26:16 <skram> https://i.imgur.com/SyuaLKP.png
20:27:59 <Dot`> is chuunibyou as cute as ppl claim?
20:28:13 <Dot`> and how was the goat violance anime?
20:28:31 <Camail> i enjoyed chu2 a lot
20:28:42 <Camail> ignore the second season
20:28:47 <Camail> it's a perfect 1 season show
20:29:49 <skram> eh its kinda funny and a bit cringey
20:29:52 <Camail> nichijou is also very very good
20:30:08 <skram> goat violence is a bit much
20:30:09 <skram> all the time
20:30:17 <Camail> nichijou is a classic
20:30:44 <skram> its where 90% of all the reaction gifs come from i guess
20:30:49 <Dot`> lol
20:30:49 <Camail> chu2 has legit amazing character development
20:31:11 <Camail> i can't argue with skram without spoiling it
20:31:47 <skram> well ive not seen enough to see any character development so i will take your word for it
20:31:48 <Camail> but the second season is kinda just an average anime that regresses into dumb stuff
20:32:41 <Camail> cringe is a plot device
20:32:52 <Camail> its not watamote, so its not a core piece
20:33:03 <Camail> but its part of the theme, and done really well
20:34:20 <Camail> i've watched a little bit of tanya the evil
20:34:28 <skram> sure, but even if its just a plot device its kinda hard to watch
20:34:40 <skram> repressed memories of 8th grade probably
20:34:45 <Camail> yes
20:35:13 <skram> .tell DuB` https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_eMKSRmJ0Y
20:35:33 <Camail> so never ever watch watamote
20:36:11 <Camail> i've never seen it, never plan to. the cringe just doesn't seem interest or used as a means for anything other than making you cry out of cringe
20:36:38 <skram> so its a show for masochists
20:37:06 <Camail> yes, the self hate is important for some people i guess
20:37:42 <skram> what a healthy way to live
20:37:49 <Camail> gits sac is so nostalgic for me
20:38:12 <Camail> the folder labeled "no" has me concerned
20:38:41 <skram> never mind that
20:38:52 <Dot`> lol
20:38:52 <Camail> ok
20:39:14 <Camail> you should put monster musume in that folder
20:39:27 <skram> haha
20:41:30 <Camail> yea skram you will probably want to play the berserker in poe, they are reworking the rage mechanic, so you can be a barbarian
20:41:34 <Camail> no dwarves, sadly
20:43:18 <skram> useless
20:45:46 <skram> is the new season out already cam
20:45:55 <Camail> nope, not for a week
20:46:02 <skram> good timing
20:46:24 <Camail> i'm planning on playing 7th-9th
20:46:44 <Camail> kinda wanna give some nerds a day to play and steal a build that looks cool
20:46:56 <Camail> i was actually making my own but there are enough changes coming that i dunno
20:47:14 <skram> should be off that weekend
20:48:09 <Camail> Runbunny are you gonna go hard once the counter hits 0 or do you wanna breeze through the story with us on the weekend
20:48:20 <Camail> Dot` also do you want to like...beat the game on synthesis
20:48:32 <Camail> cuz we could do that right now
20:51:16 <Dot`> i must sleep soon :(
20:56:04 <reification> detroit metal city is a good choice skram
21:06:52 <Runbunny> I really like the league start.
21:07:12 <Runbunny> Everyone is a pleb and there are toucans in the chats.

21:41:26 <Camail> hmm runbun, there's a new div card for a 6link il100 bow
21:41:37 <Camail> i dont know how good that is, or how much that matters
