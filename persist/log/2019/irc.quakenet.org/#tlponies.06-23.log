12:54:00 <reification> clearly it's too terrifying for our fragile eyes
12:57:08 <Cane> So the Stygian Vise that I put in the guild stash a while ago? Nobody picked it up because it doesn't have resistances. It is, however, worth between 3 and 8 exalts.
12:57:13 <Cane> So uh
12:57:16 <Cane> I think I'll take that back.
12:57:20 <Cane> Nobody else wanted it.
12:57:41 <skram> hahah
12:57:45 <skram> why is it worth so much
12:57:52 <Cane> Perfect rolls on things that matter.
12:58:01 <Cane> - 99 life
12:58:03 <skram> resistances matter, damnit!
12:58:04 <Cane> - 30% increased fire damage
12:58:10 <Cane> - 25& increased elemental damage
12:58:12 <Cane> %
12:58:29 <skram> ...pretty good
12:58:34 <Cane> Rich people can use it as a base to slam another ex on it to add whatever they like.
12:59:00 <Cane> And of course it's a Stygian Vise, so if you still need res after slamming a 45% res on it, the jewel takes care of the rest.

17:58:47 <Cane> Camail, I found 3 Jeweled Foils, ilvl 83, including a Shaped one.
17:59:22 <Camail> nice, i dunno if shaped is good, let me check the affixes
18:00:00 <Cane> Yeah it doesn't say anything about it needing to be shaped, so I assume some shaper affixes probably get in the way of the stuff you DO want.
18:00:04 <Cane> But it'd be neat I suppose.
18:01:20 <Camail> yea shaper isn't great for phys builds, lots of ele affixes
18:01:41 <Camail> it's good for ele melee builds though
18:02:55 <Camail> they're selling for 5c as a base though
18:03:11 <Camail> well, 6-9 realistically
18:16:53 <Cane> I'm hanging on to this jewel for Rael. It's pretty okay. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/112498538897776640/592417063553990666/unknown.png

20:30:28 <Camail> this thing is worth quite a lot
20:32:57 <Runbunny> There's a fix to rng Reif?
20:36:33 <Cane> That is a LOT of exalts Cam.
20:37:35 <Camail> there are 2 belts that are on the market at around 70c
20:37:49 <Camail> so i dunno if it's a ton of exalts but i could price check it
20:38:00 <Cane> Hmmm.
20:49:48 <reification> runbun i hope so, got a 400k chip stack on the sochi live qualifier atm
21:02:59 <Cane> Darn, too many random modifiers: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/112512700420005888/592459572388692045/unknown.png
21:03:49 <Camail> it's still worth something, tho
21:04:10 <Cane> Yeah, ~10 chaos maybe?
21:04:11 <Camail> the only bad affixes are the hybrid and the evasion
21:04:23 <Camail> i'd say 15 at least
21:04:30 <Cane> I'll try 15.
21:05:07 <Camail> with CI being worse chaos res is more popular
21:05:54 <reification> dot i just ended up on a person's twitter who's last name is "reif" :O https://twitter.com/KingstonAReif
21:06:00 <reification> i didn't know that was a thing
21:07:02 <DoT`> time to go hunt and prooove your the alpha reif
21:09:21 <reification> to be fair it looks like he shares my no. 1 political concern: not starting more dumb wars
21:11:39 <DoT`> its a good stance
21:34:17 <Camail> Cane so people have generally come to the conclusion that farming legion with contagion/ED is REALLY strong
21:34:29 <Camail> to the point where people are farming maps like strand
21:35:04 <Camail> legion drops a ton of currency at any tier so they pick easily sustained maps
21:37:04 <Cane> Camail, I sold it for 40. We were way off.
21:37:25 <Camail> hmm, that's way more than i thought
21:37:42 <Cane> Also, yeah, I'm leveling a Contagion/ED as a secondary so I can legion farm like mad.
21:37:50 <Cane> One single contagion hits EVERYTHING.
21:37:53 <Camail> the life was more important than i thought
21:37:56 <Cane> Literally all of them get tagged.
21:38:09 <Cane> And if you contagion right as they pop, most of them get tagged again.
21:38:22 <Cane> So yeah, it melts legion ez.
21:38:43 <Cane> Contagion/ED was the easy, effortless winner char of SSF Hardcore.
21:38:56 <Cane> And like 5 out of the top 10 were that.
21:41:36 <Camail> well, it killed most of them
21:41:52 <Camail> because they were getting off screened after breaking everything
21:44:43 <Cane> Oh yeah, but that's the legion being bullshit.
21:44:58 <Cane> In SC you can just wreck it and not worry.
