18:42:24 <Runbunny> I kinda want to hit 60 in wow, then play a bit more of poe.
18:44:22 <Runbunny> I did see a picture on reddit with stuff all over the screen.
18:48:15 <Camail> that was a blighted map, so it doesn't always look like that
18:48:25 <Camail> tho sometimes it gets awful
18:48:44 <Camail> the screen clutter is actually pretty bad...

20:16:25 <skram> I am a bit sceptical
20:16:28 <skram> after all
20:16:31 <skram> you did steal my heart
20:17:00 <DoT`> i would trust rawr with anything
20:17:03 <DoT`> and everything
20:17:36 <DoT`> that is one sweet pad jonas

20:18:06 <skram> haha
20:18:53 <skram> well it is a bit big for lil old me dot and theres things that needs fixin', but if its cheap enough I might consider it
20:19:21 <DoT`> you need space for me to visit
20:19:45 <DoT`> and there is a extra Soverom
20:20:31 <skram> the second soverom is illegal because there's no fire escape :(
20:20:41 <DoT`> thats a thing?
20:21:08 <skram> yeah
20:21:27 <skram> since its below ground it doesnt have big enough windows to escape through
20:21:43 <skram> and if its on the second floor or above you need a ladder
20:23:08 <DoT`> yea, i got no such thing
20:23:26 <DoT`> im at the 3rd floor 
20:23:30 <skram> pretty sure you're supposed to
20:23:36 <skram> though neither do I at my current apt
20:29:39 <Camail> skram you gonna start poe this weekend?
20:29:46 <Camail> i could roll up a new boy to play with you
20:30:03 <Camail> dot could try minions
20:30:07 <Camail> minions are hella strong
20:30:09 <skram> think so
20:30:19 <Camail> and i wanna try sab mines, maybe
20:30:22 <skram> i dont know if im gonna be busy or not
20:30:30 <Camail> no rush
20:30:56 <Camail> i'll have plenty to do on my main, i'm gonna be chill once i do shaper
20:32:06 <skram> how far are you?
20:32:53 <Camail> doing red elder/guardians
20:33:00 <skram> jeez
20:33:00 <Camail> doing nothing atm because servers are awful
20:33:11 <Camail> and just kinda doing random maps and shaping my atlas
20:33:11 <skram> werent you gonna go soft this season
20:33:22 <Camail> yes, this season as a whole
20:33:44 <Camail> going hard the first week lets me reap the benefits all season
20:33:52 <skram> i guess
20:34:08 <skram> how's herald of agony this season
20:35:11 <Camail> the minion meta is strong
20:35:43 <Camail> cold iron point is a dagger that gives you +3 levels to it
20:36:09 <Camail> so if you dual wield, that's +6
20:36:30 <skram> cool, maybe ill do that again
20:36:35 <skram> or some magic bitch build
20:36:42 <skram> havent really looked at anything yet

21:56:21 <skram> Hasnt hob been losing it for like 5 years now dot
21:56:35 <reification> that's all you've been telling us about him for a while dot
21:57:04 <DoT`> true, but he is at the same spot as when i last checked about an hour and a half ago
21:57:31 <DoT`> reif, runbun has been telling me that the past few days
21:57:43 <DoT`> so i thought to return the favour
22:03:32 <DoT`> he keeps dying to ponies
22:03:58 <Runbunny> Hob is really bad at doing stuff he hasn't done before.
22:04:28 <Runbunny> improvisation and doing stuff on the fly isn't his strong suit.
22:04:42 <Runbunny> and the stream amplifies it.
