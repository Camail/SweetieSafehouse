18:09:41 <Runbunny> Just about to fight the reborn king Thordan.
18:10:00 <Runbunny> Literally just entered the trial.
18:10:09 <Dot> what is this runbun?
18:10:23 <Runbunny> Anime.
18:10:37 <Dot> there are many animes
18:10:56 <Runbunny> Final Fantasy XIV
18:10:56 <skram> at least 9
18:11:28 <Dot> skram has seen like 7 anime now, he is almost all caught up then
18:11:57 <skram> XIV is 14 innit so theres at LEAST 14
18:12:01 <Zounds> Runbunny: that fight is aesthetic af
18:16:04 <Runbunny> Yeah, I had no clue what was going on. It went super fast as well.
18:17:09 <Runbunny> Old man = Defeated.
18:17:26 <Zounds> good cuz he's a dick
18:23:02 <Camail> so despite having a full beard people still get my age wrong by like...5-6 years
18:23:13 <Camail> twice yesterday people thought i was 21
18:23:20 <Camail> motherfuckers, do i have young EYES?
18:23:24 <Camail> i have no face anymore!
18:24:14 <Dot> is it a fake beard?
18:25:21 <Camail> no, but it would serve the same purpose
18:26:55 <Dot> how many times today have you been told " it must be so nice to look so much younger than you are"
18:26:59 <Dot> "your so lucky"
18:30:28 <Camail> its not daily, but any time the conversation comes up that is a line
18:30:42 <Camail> but then the other people with young faces are like "yea it fuckin sucks"
18:30:53 <Camail> and those are the only ones that matter
18:31:15 <Camail> commiseration is key
18:31:55 <Camail> cuz it turns out everyone is ageist, and will treat you differently if they think you're younger
18:32:01 <Camail> either in a positive or negative way
18:32:20 <Dot> i know it well, it does indeed suck
18:40:18 <Golly> im old enough that looking younger is mostly a positive
18:40:48 <Golly> ie people think im late 20s when im mid 30s

18:46:34 <Golly> was pretty funny when there was a new girl at work, 19yo, and they were like you should hit that
18:46:46 <Golly> meanwhile guy same age as me was told to back off, lol
18:50:37 <Camail> talking to a teenager is like...the last thing i would want to do at this point
18:52:34 <skram> y'all baby faced
18:52:40 <skram> i look like im 35
18:53:27 <Camail> are you actually 25
18:54:00 <skram> 43
18:54:03 <skram> na im 27
18:54:24 <Camail> try stretching your face to appear younger
18:54:31 <Camail> or at least to scare people
18:55:11 <skram> i dont know if thats gonna work
18:56:21 <skram> what if i end up having a long face
18:56:42 <Camail> well then you can live some peoples' life long dream of being a horse
19:00:26 <Camail> also a little late but while playing vtm bloodlines i was able to get some nice bunnyhops going once i realized it was a source engine game
19:03:46 <Camail> and sv_cheats is 1 by default so i got to noclip through some particularly awful/buggy parts

19:16:55 <Cane> Dot, I got sick of the "avenge my fallen comrade and I'll give you his old rifle" quest never actually giving you a fucking gun, so I made it give you one.
19:16:56 <Runbunny> If I recall it was actually the first game released on the source engine.
19:16:56 <Cane> That is all.
19:23:21 <Camail> Cane make it say that you will get 2 guns, but only give one
19:23:29 <Camail> maybe the disappointment was part of the journey
19:23:30 <Dot> haha cane
19:24:35 <Cane> You still have a chance of getting a shitty worn-out hunting shotgun from like 1968.
