18:27:52 <Dot> DUB
18:28:09 <DuB`> Halloz
18:28:20 <BioPhone> DOB PLS
18:31:08 <DuB`> Busy busy
18:31:23 <DuB`> Picked up my MASTER WIZARD ROBES on campus just now
18:33:17 <BioPhone> But I'm the wizard, u is the ranger
18:38:13 <Zounds> ranger lel
18:38:26 <Zounds> I bet he plays stealth archery in elder scrolls games
18:38:30 <Zounds> like 99% of the rest of us
18:38:58 <Zounds> even my conjurer build ended up using sneak and a conjured bow to stealth archery people
18:46:13 <Camail> Runbunny i bit the bullet and got a good weapon =/
18:46:33 <Runbunny> Elaborate?
18:46:35 <Camail> it doesnt have crit chance but like...i really dont need it as much as damage pen
18:46:45 <Camail> got a sambar scepter and multimodded it
18:46:53 <Runbunny> oh.
18:47:19 <Runbunny> For some reason, i thought this was monster hunter related :D
18:47:28 <Runbunny> I was very confused.
18:47:35 <Camail> i feel like i got a pretty good deal, got a 14% pen 12% extra chaos 15% cast speed scepter for only 60c
18:47:53 <Camail> then multimodded spell damage and more chaos
18:48:19 <Runbunny> Sounds pretty good.
18:50:11 <Camail> might try uber elder tonight
18:50:42 <Camail> and if it fails again, guess my next goal is to run a bunch of lab, then when that fails i can maybe buy a winter orb ench
18:51:17 <Runbunny> Trying to get the enchant yourself is pretty rough.
18:51:53 <Runbunny> https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/List_of_helmet_enchantment_mods
18:52:01 <Camail> yea yea
18:52:04 <Camail> i know...
18:52:13 <Camail> i have a decent base so if i get a good ench i can sell it
18:52:22 <Camail> that's my realistic best case
