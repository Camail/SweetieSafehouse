19:56:47 <Dot`> pff, even estops should be autmated and not touchable
19:57:24 <skrm> you're terrible dot
19:57:49 <Dot`> <3
19:58:37 <skrm> what are you making your arduino do BioPone 
19:58:42 <skrm> are you building a terrible robot
19:58:53 <BioPone> Nein.
19:59:03 <BioPone> It tests car parts
20:02:59 <skrm> well
20:03:03 <skrm> it could be both
20:03:58 <Golly> can a transformer also be a mechanic
20:05:18 <Phearlock> I assume so. It's like a medic in transformerland
20:05:30 <Phearlock> Carries a toolkit with a red cross
20:05:59 <Golly> hello mam i need to check your undercarriage
20:07:03 <BioPone> That's surely been said in a crappy porn
20:07:23 <BioPone> Someone versed in degeneracy can verify
20:07:56 <BioPone> Also dot we have estops on our projects
20:08:04 <BioPone> And they are all big red buttons
20:08:13 <BioPone> V v v satisfying to punch
20:08:57 <skrm> dont punch the estops you barbarian
20:09:01 <skrm> caress them
20:09:01 <skrm> gently
20:09:25 <Dot`> i think all estops are red
20:09:29 <Dot`> and pushy
20:10:14 <BioPone> They like it rough skrm
20:10:26 <skrm> absolutely not
20:10:52 <BioPone> My buttons luv getting pawnched
20:10:55 <BioPone> Fact
20:11:16 <skrm> did you read the cenelec yet Dot` 
20:11:21 <Dot`> the wat
20:11:30 <skrm> im 75% certain it says all estops have to be red and yellow
20:12:21 <Dot`> estops are not to be touched, instead isolate the whole panel
20:12:40 <Dot`> cant trust anything
20:12:54 <Dot`> and lock off the panel with a label and padlock
20:13:00 <skrm> its the boys that standardize electrotechnical things
20:13:06 <skrm> together with IEC
20:13:24 <Dot`> ah
20:13:39 <Dot`> and yea, every Estop has to be red i tihnk in england
20:13:57 <BioPone> Facts
20:14:26 <skrm> well you usually dont have time to do proper LOTO procedure when your hand is stuck in a machine
20:14:29 <Golly> if i push the one at my job it usually means a child doesnt get the magical conveyor adventure
20:14:30 <Golly> sad
20:14:39 <skrm> Sad!
20:14:44 <Dot`> No fun allowed golly?
20:14:55 <skrm> airports are no fun for anyone
20:15:16 <Dot`> i dont go near anything electrical skram until its all safe becuase im a coward
20:15:59 <Dot`> the panels do have 480 volts in them, but its behind the stuff and is very tricky yo touh
20:17:15 <Dot`> there is a pump on the site im currently at that when they got to site was still powered and had no cover
20:17:24 <Dot`> if it came on it was a spinning blade
20:17:36 <Dot`> not doing anything but looking for fingers
20:18:27 <skrm> its fine maybe
20:20:27 <skrm> you got like 10 of them so its fine to lose a few

23:15:54 <Dot`> so makes sense
23:17:08 <Camail> and so soon, dot
23:17:13 <Camail> jewel prices are waaay down
23:17:18 <Camail> so they should be easy to buy
23:17:36 <Dot`> they are like 14 cs
23:17:39 <Dot`> thats a lot!
23:17:45 <Dot`> i have like 8 total
23:17:55 <Camail> the expensive one is ~30c
23:18:01 <Camail> it was 60c a week ago
23:18:53 <DuB`> And cam had to walk uphill both ways to get his
23:19:13 <Camail> i dont have one
23:19:25 <Camail> i've been aware of the price because of multiple people i know using golems

23:21:10 <DuB`> Ya dot
23:28:44 <Dot`> skram, large cities are scary
23:29:12 <DuB`> It's not even that big look, most of the important bits fit in that one picture! 
23:30:11 <Dot`> thats only the central part! and how many ppl live there?
23:30:23 <Dot`> and its not even the whole centre
23:30:33 <DuB`> 1.6m but it cuts off the bronx :P

23:42:18 <Runbunny> But Dot is equally terrifying.
23:42:25 <Runbunny> So it balances out.
