17:43:14 <skram> but it got sold way over my budget
17:43:35 <skram> like 2 and a half million king haralds
17:45:17 <Dot> i know it was days ago, but i didnt hear any more about it
17:45:45 <skram> It was pretty nice though, but it had some faults
17:46:09 <skram> but it had a nice view so its automagically worth like 500k extra
