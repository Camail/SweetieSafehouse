00:05:33 <Cane> How's things?
00:05:57 <Crisium> ok, worn out cause i started running agian and i think i ran too hard for a rusty person heh
00:05:58 <Crisium> hows u
00:06:54 <Cane> Well damn, that's good to hear though. Keep at it man. =)
00:07:10 <Cane> I'm good, found out that my favourite STALKER mod has a big update so I'm just killing time while furiously waiting for that to finish downloading.
00:07:29 <Crisium> oh right you were the stalker guru
00:07:50 <Crisium> im trying to decide whether or not to get Control which launches tomorrow
00:07:51 <Cane> I might have to stream for once.
00:08:53 <Cane> That's by the Alan Wake people, right?
00:16:38 <Cane> Hell yeah done downloading.
00:16:45 <Cane> Time to spend an hour setting the damned thing up.
00:16:55 <Cane> And then maybe streaming it, who knows.
00:18:15 <skram> godspeed, cane
00:21:09 <DuB`> Crisium, just grabbed my free Control key from gpu purchase :P
00:21:18 <DuB`> Gonna trace all the rays
00:21:22 <Crisium> DuB` !
00:21:28 <Crisium> yeah i cant run ray tracing on my 1080
00:21:53 <Crisium> but i refuse to buy 2000 series out of principle
00:22:21 <skram> what principle would that even be
00:25:07 <Crisium> 12nm tech in 2019
00:25:14 <Crisium> it's barbaric
00:25:32 <Crisium> also gen 1 RTX
00:25:40 <Crisium> next year we'll have 7nm Nvidia
00:25:48 <Crisium> faster, Gen 2 RTX
00:26:31 <Crisium> look at the first DX11 GPUs - Radeon 5870 and GTX 480.  Worthless today
00:26:48 <Crisium> but look at the second.  Radeon 7970 and GTX 680, cau still run games
00:26:59 <Crisium> 2nd gen gets waaay more life
00:27:25 <DuB`> Unfortunately my gtx1070 was dead currently, not next year :P
00:27:27 <Crisium> even considering they launched 2.5 years later.  7970 in 2019 is better than 5870 in 2016
00:27:38 <Crisium> yeah DuB` you had no choice lol
00:27:43 <Crisium> so enjoy your 2080
00:27:47 <Crisium> ^_^
00:28:43 <skram> couldnt you just run mobo gfx til next gen?
00:29:02 <DuB`> One month of that nearly killed me, skram!
00:29:26 <skram> embrace the dark ages, DuB`
00:29:40 <skram> buy note sheets and hum in the darkness instead of spotify
00:30:14 <Crisium> i'm just gonna buy the next non-Titan that's faster than the 2080 Ti
00:30:18 <Crisium> whether thats 3080 or 3080 Ti
00:41:39 <Cane> RTX 2070 checking in. Interesting card, don't think I'll upgrade any time soon, but it does feel like a stepping stone between more interesting titles.

05:01:35 <DoT|Phone> so not as complete as they promised then :/
05:02:39 <DoT|Phone> though it is stalker
05:10:17 <Cane> Yeah, I'll do some troubleshooting later, I've just got shit to do today.
05:10:32 <Cane> Sucks, because Anomaly 1.4 was one of the more stable builds I've ever played.
05:10:42 <Cane> And now 1.5 is the worst.
05:11:23 <DoT|Phone> maybe they will update it with fixes over the next week or so
05:11:27 <DoT|Phone> I can dream
05:11:42 <Cane> There was already one hotfix. Hope another one will come out.
05:12:09 <Cane> Maybe tomorrow I'll join their Discord (supposedly they're very active devs) and ask for help.

20:09:03 <DoT`> !
20:09:07 <DoT`> hows you
20:09:21 <skrma> doin alright
20:10:00 <skrma> i left my car on with the headlights for like 5 hours so I had to do a lil trip round town to charge the battery up again
20:10:08 <skrma> how many valves did you test today?
20:10:17 <DoT`> 7!
20:10:31 <DoT`> they are bad at wires
20:11:31 <skrma> so it would seem
20:11:42 <skrma> how big are these valves anyway
20:14:43 <DoT`> i dont really know
20:14:45 <DoT`> not massive
20:14:58 <DoT`> they take 20 seconds to open/close but that doesnt say much
20:15:18 <skrma> sizeable then
20:15:28 <skrma> motor actuated?
20:15:46 <DoT`> yea
20:16:12 <skrma> are you using AUMA actuators
20:18:11 <DoT`> i dlnt know
20:18:20 <DoT`> i jusr send the beep signal
20:19:00 <DuB|fon> If beep then boop
20:19:08 <skrma> well
20:19:09 <skrma> basically
20:19:57 <DoT`> but skram, also, could an actuated valve not be really tiny?
20:20:57 <skrma> if they're motor actuated its because they require a fair bit of torque and are thus pretty big
20:21:22 <skrma> else you just use pneumaticly or solenoid actuated valves
20:21:26 <DoT`> i only know moterised and solenoid
20:21:29 <skrma> which can be tiny obviously
20:22:16 <skrma> proptional valves are usually pneumatic in my experience
20:22:29 <skrma> or mid sized butterfly type valves
20:22:43 <DoT`> we have some butterfly valves i think
20:22:47 <DoT`> for polymer dosing
20:24:40 <skrma> is polymer the bit that does the flocculation thing
20:24:50 <DoT`> yea
20:24:58 <DoT`> so they can make thhe cakes
20:25:01 <DoT`> the bad cakes
20:25:20 <skrma> the nope quiche
20:26:11 <skrma> i guess butterfly valves is alright unless you want very precise measurements
20:26:40 <skrma> if you needed that you'd probably use a screw or a rotary feeder
20:27:25 <DoT`> there are mixer things as well, i tihnk these are just used to get within a certain range
20:29:03 <skrma> its pretty neat stuff
20:29:30 <Camail> DuB|fon  look at these nerds
20:29:43 <skrma> we had a babby treatment plant at the place where i apprenticed
20:31:00 <DuB|fon> Extra nerds
