00:33:48 <DuB`> It has rained here every day for 5 days now :O
00:33:50 <DuB`> Some desert
00:52:31 <DuB`> Ah, xcom 2 still on -75% sale
00:52:43 <DuB`> Question is, do I just get vanilla or some of the -50% dlc...
00:58:13 <Camail> neither, get monster hunter
00:58:18 <Camail> superior tactical shooter
00:58:30 <DuB`> Uh 
00:58:31 <DuB`> huh
01:00:04 <DuB`> LoN so OP, I was throwing out 50B blessed shield crits less than an hour after hitting 70, in full int necro gear :P
01:01:31 <Camail> yea the more i learn about it, the more i realize i dislike LoN more than i do sets in general
01:02:24 <DuB`> It's really weird
01:03:02 <DuB`> We need reissue, just cut all the set/legendary effects down to 10% of current :P
01:03:14 <DuB`> START OVER
01:04:36 <Camail> i'd like a new gameplay feature
01:04:47 <Camail> but i know we will never get one
01:04:58 <Camail> they only have game designers on d3 at this point
01:12:02 <Runbunny> On that note.
01:12:11 <Runbunny> Get Monster Hunter.
01:18:30 <Runbunny> Sleep.

16:12:04 <DuB`> Man my guys aren't even good enough to have 95%s :P
16:12:09 <DuB`> Always 60-70 lol
16:12:28 <Phearlock> high ground best ground
16:12:42 <Runbunny> The game actually lies to you. It displays 95% but it's way less.
16:12:54 <Runbunny> Phearlock!
16:13:02 <Phearlock> I mean actually xcom cheats the odds in your favor
16:13:16 <Phearlock> But it lets you miss sometimes
16:13:20 <Phearlock> usually at a bad time
16:13:47 <Runbunny> Some times. 
16:14:13 <Runbunny> It very heavily cheated against me in my iron man last mission thing in the first game.

20:27:39 <skram> those guys are the worst, DuB`
20:28:05 <Dot`> elves are worse skram
20:28:14 <skram> hmm
20:28:20 <skram> thats a tough call
20:31:03 <Dot`> hmm, are you the real skram?
20:31:48 <Dot`> the only tough call is which kind of elf is the worst
20:32:18 <skram> that one's easy
20:32:22 <skram> its the ones with the ears
20:33:03 <Dot`> but how do you choose between drow edginess and wood elf extra tree huginess
20:33:29 <skram> drow edginess is the one redeeming feature of elves, Dot`
20:34:17 <Dot`> i think you will find its how long they live skram, becuase it means when you kill them its so much more of an elf life taken
20:34:54 <Phearlock> Elf lives matter
20:34:58 <skram> no
20:35:00 <Phearlock> The amount of them you've ruined that is
20:35:11 <skram> ayy
20:35:15 <skram> you done me a bamboozle
20:35:24 <Dot`> aayyy

20:40:53 <Dot`> too tall
20:41:09 <skram> hmm

20:41:51 <skram> too small

20:49:13 <Runbunny> It would seem that you two are destined to be mortal enemies forever.
20:49:35 <skram> like norwegians and danes
20:49:51 <Runbunny> And swedes and danes.
20:49:57 <skram> and danes and danes
20:50:07 <Runbunny> Ofc.
20:50:10 <Golly> danes, they ruined denmark
20:50:14 <Runbunny> Have you been to Jylland?
20:50:36 <skram> yeah
20:51:25 <skram> thats where legoland is, anders
20:51:29 <Runbunny> I think there was a partion a few years ago, about having the danes leave Denmark.
20:51:42 <skram> where would they go
20:52:37 <Golly> canada
20:54:26 <Runbunny> Canada sounds like a nice place.
20:54:34 <Runbunny> I should go at some point.
20:54:50 <Golly> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrJ-kN4P-Xo
20:56:02 <Runbunny> We don't like hockey though.
20:56:14 <skram> its not that cold either
20:56:35 <Runbunny> It really isn't.
20:56:36 <Golly> its onlt sweden that gets accurate jokes about them
20:56:49 <Runbunny> Finnish people as well.
20:57:30 <skram> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk0h1WcPMHI
20:57:34 <skram> this is pretty accurate though
20:58:52 <Runbunny> Silly swedes.
20:59:08 <skram> they're adorable
21:02:16 <Runbunny> skram, https://youtu.be/mLdTpyFmr8c?t=110
21:03:41 <skram> HELT DÅSE
21:03:50 <skram> this is awful and you should feel bad on their behalf, anders
21:04:11 <Crisium> i prefer the hockey northerners
21:04:19 <Crisium> so sweden and finland win
21:04:25 <skram> the good ones or the slightly better ones
21:09:25 <skram> .tell Runbunny https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Mz0trc-ZpY
21:10:28 <Runbunny> Jonas it's too bad that the Boku review isn't on youtube anymore.
21:10:49 <skram> a travesty, no doubt

22:24:52 <Rawr|Fone> Skram you just told dot that you would stay safe
22:27:39 <skraam> i never said that
22:33:03 <skraam> henrik ive been working with a guy from skåne for a few days now
22:33:12 <skraam> i understand almost 40% of the things he says
22:33:29 <Rawr|Fone> Where in skåne though
22:33:40 <Runbunny> Across the bridge.
22:33:43 <Runbunny> It's Benny.
22:33:47 <Runbunny> The Dane.
22:33:59 <skraam> Not sure, Rawr, but skåne isnt that big??
22:34:12 <skraam> No, Benny's retired now I think, Anders
22:34:19 <Runbunny> Oh really?
22:34:26 <Rawr|Fone> Not really skram
22:34:28 <Runbunny> You have no danish comrades then?
22:34:46 <skraam> Well there's the other Vølund boys that show up each summer
22:35:31 <Rawr|Fone> You should ask him about his hometown skram
22:36:38 <skraam> I will do that
22:36:59 <skraam> He's a welder, maybe you know him
22:37:03 <Rawr|Fone> There is only one acceptable answer though
22:37:23 <skraam> which one is that
22:38:28 <Rawr|Fone> Malmööööööööö
22:40:55 <skraam> hell yeah buddy
22:44:33 <Rawr|Fone> I bet he is from the eastern part though
22:44:40 <Rawr|Fone> Probably sjöbo
22:44:43 <skraam> is that the bad part?
22:47:49 <Rawr|Fone> Yes
22:48:44 <skraam> They're all ruffians I bet
