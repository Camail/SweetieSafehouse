23:37:10 <Cane> DoT`, STALKER Anomaly just had a big update. I think I know what I'm doing this week.

23:59:55 <Cane> Some changes include richer environments (no need for huge terrain texture mods), weather options, HUD optimization and customization, difficulty options (stamina, carry weight, armor etc), built-in shaders, borderless windowed mode, more realistic damage, several new weapons and armors, better dynamic items and stashes (and looting), more quests, more side-quests for the storyline, improvements to A-Life, and then I stopped reading because I 
23:59:55 <Cane> had a trouser accident.
