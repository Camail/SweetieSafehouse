18:44:39 <DoT`> so how long did it take him?
18:45:15 <skram> well it was out on monday so less than 5 days
18:47:34 <BioPhone> This mans at lvl60, I couldn't even log in Tues and wed
18:47:38 <skram> surely less than the 41 days it took me when i was 13 lel
18:47:47 <BioPhone> F
18:48:08 <BioPhone> Skrm my guild is swapping to a lower pop server.... and alliance
18:48:11 <BioPhone> Ew
18:48:16 <skram> finally
18:48:29 <skram> horde sucks
18:48:47 <skram> paladins > shamans
18:49:15 <BioPhone> False on all accounts
18:49:28 <BioPhone> But imma make a war I think
18:49:43 <BioPhone> If imma be ally maybe I go diff class too
18:49:47 <skram> not at all actually, paladong blessings/auras were way more helpful than totems
18:49:54 <BioPhone> But.
18:49:59 <BioPhone> Lust.
18:50:08 <BioPhone> And windfury is borkens
18:50:35 <skram> bloodlust came with BC
18:50:38 <BioPhone> I'll give ally the edge on healers tho.
18:50:41 <skram> windfury is really good tho
18:50:42 <BioPhone> Orly
18:50:48 <BioPhone> Well then
18:51:10 <BioPhone> My only counter argument is... my life for sylvannas
18:51:15 <DoT`> alliance is best
18:51:40 <skram> blessing of kings is real good, and blessing of salvation was a big thing on some bosses
18:52:00 <skram> though if vanilla's on 1.2, greater blessings dont exist yet lel
18:52:02 <Camail> yea but alliance had a bunch of whiny babies
18:52:39 <Camail> and horde didn't have to deal with a bunch of thirst tweens paying gold for NE strippers
18:52:55 <skram> horde are all edgy lil shits, cam
18:53:00 <Camail> we had respectable undead strippers
18:53:04 <skram> the aestethic is TRASH

23:24:41 <skrma> the NFL game looks the same
23:24:42 <Cane> Oh no. I have more games from them.
23:25:04 <Cane> Well, I've got about 2100 games, so here's hoping we won't land on them.
23:25:18 <CockRoac1|42> the monopoly game is MULTIPLAYER! :O
23:25:22 <skrma> you're inviting some awful scenarios with that talk, cane
23:26:02 <Cane> Well, today was a mixed bag of sorts.

23:26:51 <Cane> The least interesting thing I played was the freaking AAA-for-the-time title Eye of the Beholder 3.
23:27:14 <Cane> A freaking Forgotten Realms licensed RPG with tons of spells. That somehow managed to be the most mindnumbing.
23:27:39 <Cane> And instead a little indie game called Dark Wolf that had a wizard with a bouncing wizard hat was the most endearing thing.
23:28:01 <skrma> indie games in 1993
23:28:02 <skrma> what a world
23:28:07 <Cane> Good times.
