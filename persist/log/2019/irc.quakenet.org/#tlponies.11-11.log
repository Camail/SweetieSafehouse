22:30:54 <Camail> no regrets
22:31:48 <DuB`> Never regrets
22:33:00 <Dot`> ive never seen pizza rolls
22:33:09 <Dot`> they must exist in this country, im sure
22:33:23 <Crisium> za rolls
22:33:42 <skram> im 97$ sure ive sent you pictures of pizza rolls dot
22:33:51 <Camail> lewd
22:34:08 <Camail> skram sends pics of his rolls for 97 USD
22:34:15 <Camail> looks like i got a discount
22:34:37 <Dot`> ive seen them on tv too skram, but i meant irl
22:35:14 <Dot`> and also you where not sure if those where pizza rolls you sent me a pic of
22:36:10 <skram> hmm alright
22:37:26 <skram> am getting paid on friday and since its (almost) chrimmas i only pay half tax
22:37:35 <Dot`> weird
22:37:37 <skram> what sort of cheese should i spend the extra skrilla on
22:38:21 <Dot`> applewodd smoked cheddar
22:38:25 <Dot`> its the best
22:38:35 <Dot`> applewood*
22:38:58 <skram> how much cheddar can i get for 1000 dollarydoos do you think
22:39:08 <Dot`> hmm, almost enough
22:39:16 <skram> i see
22:39:25 <skram> actually, maybe get a gamepad?
22:39:30 <Dot`> your probably just going to buy a body pillow though
22:39:35 <skram> cam DuB` what do you guys use
22:39:36 <Dot`> a high quality one
22:39:46 <DuB`> xbox thingie
22:39:49 <Camail> i use the xbox pro controller
22:39:54 <skram> im gonna get a komi-san body pillow where the one side is the innocent side
22:40:03 <skram> and the other side is also innocent because lewding komi-san is illegal
22:40:24 <DuB`> Good
22:40:36 <DuB`> Speaking of komi san... hohmygoodness the last few chapters...
22:40:36 <Dot`> needs more Panzer IV
22:41:12 <Camail> WEEEEBS
22:41:13 <skram> oooh boi
22:41:50 <skram> can you just use a oem console controller no problem on the computers?
22:43:05 <skram> or do i need to get the razer 1337 gamer RGB noscope360 mlg pro version
22:43:21 <DuB`> Googling oem, sec
22:43:52 <DuB`> I mean xbox is microsoft, they make sure it plays nice with pc
22:44:01 <skram> right right
22:44:09 <DuB`> I used ps4 controller back when doing the streetfights and that took a bit more work
22:44:12 <DuB`> Dunno if that has changed
22:44:49 <skram> maybe ill just go to the store and ask the nerds down there
22:46:01 <skram> ooh dot theres a farmers market next week and theres a farm selling cheese made from GOATS
22:47:29 <Camail> skram all controllers need drivers, xbox ones all work flawlessly plug and play, ps4 needs community drivers but it's fine after that
22:47:51 <Camail> there's no sony support for pc tho
22:48:23 <Dot`> goats cheese can be great
22:48:27 <Dot`> also can be aweful
22:48:30 <Camail> if you get the xbox elite controller i suggest getting the new one because there are problems with the original
22:48:47 <Dot`> there was this pepper goats cheese in SA, it was the best
22:49:44 <Dot`> amd skram, there is a 3 week long market at chatsworth starting soon with a choclate brownie stand you need to come get from
22:50:48 <Camail> so much food
