16:39:20 <DoT`> i had some ricecakes with cottage cheese on, but should probably have supper before i go sleep
16:39:56 <skram> ricecakes
16:40:01 <skram> very nutricious
16:40:17 <skram> nutritious?
16:41:03 <reification> yes but no
16:41:56 <skram> well its got carbs
16:42:02 <skram> thats all you need, right?
16:42:47 <reification> the one out of the three macronutrients you don't actually need skram
16:44:57 <skram> brain needs glucose though?
16:46:02 <reification> you can make that skram
16:46:45 <skram> how does that happen reif
16:47:02 <reification> *actually my best friend from school had a kid who can't but that's a v. rare condition

16:52:09 <reification> actually if you eat all the time and never do marathons you may have gotten pretty bad at using fat for energy
16:52:43 <skram> are you saying that the only way to be fit is to run marathons?
16:53:05 <reification> nope
16:54:41 <reification> marathons are a type of exercise that will deplete your glycogen stores (storage form of glucose) thus forcing you to use fat reserves
16:56:30 <skram> that would be true for any sort of extended aerboic exercise then, no?
16:56:46 <reification> but i wouldn't recommend them for injury reasons
16:56:55 <reification> yes skram
16:57:33 <skram> hmm
16:58:01 <skram> how do you know where that threshold is
16:58:53 <reification> just not eating for 14 hours overnight should also get you there iirc
16:59:40 <skram> wait isnt that just ketosis
17:01:14 <reification> ok here is a chart for you skram https://idmprogram.com/wp-content/uploads/Starvation-1.jpg
