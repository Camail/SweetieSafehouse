14:38:17 <skram> that one was no good, really
14:38:38 <DoT|Phone> it was odd
14:38:47 <skram> it was really small and a listed building so couldnt really expand it or anything
14:38:56 <skram> even if the whole swiss chalet style is really neat
14:38:57 <DoT|Phone> hmm
14:40:12 <BioPone> I should consider looking for a house, but then I'd have to move
14:40:50 <skram> but it'd be yours, you know
14:41:04 <skram> could draw a giant dick on it and nobody could stop you
14:41:19 <DoT|Phone> property is always a good investment
14:41:30 <DoT|Phone> unless you buy a place falling apart
14:41:38 <skram> yep
14:45:07 <BioPone> Yeah, I was considering looking at buying a duplex and renting the other half of it
14:46:03 <BioPone> The other day I was curious and looked in my area. Saw a place for 7000 dollars.
14:46:09 <BioPone> I was confused.
14:46:25 <BioPone> A whole ass house for less than my car
14:46:43 <DoT|Phone> that sounds dangerous if true
14:47:07 <DoT|Phone> also you have a fancy car

18:15:45 <BioPone> Hors
18:26:53 <Camail> nah not gonna skip it, gonna push with a new skill and if it's fun keep playing
18:28:21 <Cane> What's it called when a game's FPS is stable for long periods of time, but then you suddenly have a spike of frame lag for 0.5 seconds before the game goes back to normal?
18:28:54 <Cane> "Stuttering" usually indicates frequency, and this is infrequent.
18:31:02 <Camail> i've always called it a lag spike, but that's not technically what it is
18:34:29 <Cane> Yeah there's generally agreed upon terms for all kinds of lag problems and I need the proper one so I can google this bitch.
18:34:35 <Cane> Source engine shouldn't be giving me problems.
