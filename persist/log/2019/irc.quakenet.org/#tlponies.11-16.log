00:15:57 <DuB`> mmm borger
00:15:59 <DuB`> Hi skram
00:16:07 <skram> hey there buddy
00:18:37 <Cane> fhasdjkhrgl
00:18:43 <Cane> Exercise is miserable when you feel under the weather.
00:18:54 <Cane> Hi I want to die
00:19:22 <skram> Hi cane, remember to take your tran
00:19:40 <Cane> Every day skram.
00:19:44 <Cane> 'Cuz Norway.
00:19:49 <skram> heck yeah
00:19:50 <DuB`> I think naps are better for your health than excercise if you're sick :P
00:20:11 <Cane> Not even sick, just don't feel too great today. =P
00:20:19 <DuB`> Awh
00:21:35 <skram> WEll, at least you didnt start bleeding from your inside bits like dub does when he excersises?
00:21:46 <DuB`> ONCE
00:22:07 <Cane> No of course not, how would one even *do* that?
00:22:58 <skram> heck if i know
00:23:16 <DuB`> Turns out if you redline yourself on cardio for an hour straight it makes your organs unhappy
00:23:28 <skram> how mysterious
00:33:59 <skram> where did dot run off to
00:40:27 <Camail> Cane but poe2
00:40:36 <Cane> Camail, right?
00:40:47 <Camail> cant wait to never pick scion
00:40:52 <Camail> what a useless character
00:41:02 <Camail> 38 ascendencies, never gonna be well balanced
00:41:16 <Cane> I've wanted to make a Scion character the past several leagues. There just isn't one that works.
00:41:24 <Camail> well, summoner works
00:41:26 <Cane> I've had ONE scion back when Poet's Pen / Volatile Dead was a thing.
00:41:34 <Cane> Summoner always worked, it's my go-to.
00:41:35 <Camail> i essentially played SSFHC up to 94
00:41:45 <Camail> yea but like...no summoner was never this good
00:42:00 <Cane> I heard tales of the once-upon-a-time-long-ago
00:42:01 <Camail> you can run like all blue items and to UE
00:42:06 <Cane> where, for one brief patch, summoners were awesome.
00:42:15 <Camail> that's this patch
00:42:15 <Cane> And then nothing until now.
00:42:24 <Cane> Yep.
00:42:30 <Camail> the ai change makes them funamentally better than ever
00:42:32 <Cane> And once before, in legend, in myth.
00:42:48 <Cane> Definitely curious about 2.0 though. They've been promising the overhaul for a while now.
00:42:54 <Camail> though now i know how much i dislike playing a summoner
00:43:08 <Cane> Interesting that they're just calling it Path of Exile 2. I thought they were gonna D3 it with "loot 2.0" or whatever.
00:43:11 <Cane> But this works for me.
00:43:20 <Camail> technically they are caling it both poe2 and 4.0
00:43:38 <Camail> the poe2 part comes from the new skill system and acts
00:44:03 <Camail> but 3.9 is insane with how much its changing
00:44:06 <Camail> its gonna be a bossing league
00:44:16 <Camail> every map has one big boy you build and then fight
02:01:01 <Cane> https://www.twitch.tv/beyondthesummit First Dota 2 major this season, supposedly.
02:01:19 <DuB`> Woo!
02:01:27 <DuB`> I do love watchin doto

02:49:08 <Camail> skram its late
02:49:10 <Camail> why are you here
02:49:47 <skram> good question pal
02:51:41 <skram> we should murder some zombies tomorrow tho
02:54:48 <Camail> yes
02:55:04 <Camail> we need to bully dub into playing
02:55:10 <Camail> we need to bully everyone
02:55:30 * skram slaps DuB` around a bit with a large trout
02:55:31 <skram> indeed
02:56:11 <Camail> once we get bikes we need to find a better location
02:56:15 <Camail> there's like... nothing around us
02:56:21 <Camail> there are a lot of iron nodes tho
02:56:28 <Camail> it's just really tough to loot
02:56:41 <skram> very scenic though with the lake and everything
02:57:15 <Camail> yea, maybe we just need to change our strategy
02:57:26 <Camail> looting can really only be supplementary
02:57:33 <skram> i thought we were building a retirement home
02:57:42 <Camail> i'm trying to become powerful
02:57:53 <Camail> and rule over the zombies
02:57:59 <Camail> also my other character got deleted
02:58:06 <skram> D:
02:58:09 <Camail> so i need to like... move to a city
02:58:16 <Camail> so i can have a place to play solo
02:58:37 <Camail> i'm cool with losing the data, its honestly not that bad
02:59:14 <Camail> i dont want to do the first zombie horde without you though so i cant play that world until tomorrow
02:59:35 <Camail> partly because you took are only working gun
02:59:49 <skram> lol
02:59:55 <skram> dont you have an AK?
03:00:05 <Camail> those 7 bullets wont last a whole night
03:00:15 <skram> oh right
03:00:17 <Camail> last run i had 150 shotgun rounds because i did missions
03:00:30 <Camail> this time around it is a much different dynamic
03:01:40 <skram> we have like 9 sledgehammers though
03:01:41 <skram> we'll be fine
03:02:15 <Camail> yea, i got a haul that's mostly all the way home
03:02:30 <Camail> also mapped out a bit of the main roads, there are some big buildings you can loot
03:02:37 <skram> cool beans
03:02:56 <Camail> forgot to bring the wrench which was unfortunate

17:08:48 <Crisium> its interesting Zounds
17:09:08 <Crisium> I think Orisa is still just as strong, but they moved power from the shield to her actual hero
17:09:22 <Crisium> Sigma is weaker overall but probably a needed change cause he does so much damage
17:09:25 <Crisium> Rein feels AMAZING
