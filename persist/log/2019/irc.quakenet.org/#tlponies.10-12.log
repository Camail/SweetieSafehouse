00:12:37 <DuB`> The burger place across the street seems to have gone out of business so I have to walk a whole HALF A BLOCK to the other place :T
00:21:26 <reification> how unamerican
00:22:11 <DuB`> It was terribly vexing so I splurged and spent an extra $2 on the fancy wagyu+brisket one called THE CEO
00:31:07 <reification> that sounds great. i want it
00:31:10 <reification> https://twitter.com/CreamyElephant/status/1182655843537477635
00:31:38 <DuB`> It's actually amazing, well worth the $2 and 30 seconds of walking :P
00:32:36 <DuB`> Fries are disappointing though
