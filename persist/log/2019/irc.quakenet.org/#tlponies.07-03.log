15:02:50 <skram> and apparently im just a country bumpkin because there were SO MANY things ive never even heard of in there
15:02:56 <skram> i dont know what that is
15:03:24 <skram> but its mostly east asian things i presume because there was a lot of thai writing
15:03:58 <skram> or would that be south eastern
15:04:07 <skram> whatever, they didnt have moldy rice which is what i wanted
15:17:11 <Rawr|Phone> But why

17:59:51 <DuB`> Hmm hmm
18:00:11 <Phearlock> hmm
18:00:16 <skrma> ill send you my 1080
18:00:24 <skrma> if you buy me a 2080 when you get your paycheck
18:00:28 <skrma> thats how interest works, right?
18:00:32 <DuB`> Hah
18:06:56 <Phearlock> It's like, regular stuff at 1080p, still only need a good 980 right? Then it's like VR and some screens for 1080.
18:07:09 <Phearlock> Then if you want to play minecraft and quake 2 you get the 2080

19:00:38 <DoT`> dub!
19:00:50 <DoT`> did i link you this https://imgur.com/gallery/KIOIfXZ
19:00:59 <DuB`> So my 144hz monitor has only dvi and hdmi1.4 (which doesn't do 144hz), and all the 2070 and 2080s only have hdmi and displayport
19:01:14 <DuB`> Don't think so dot, but I did see this somewhere
19:01:21 <DuB`> V pretty
19:01:44 <DuB`> I guess I go for 1080 or 2070/2080 AND a new monitor... ayaya
19:02:16 <DoT`> rip monies
19:02:51 <DuB`> Is this my chance to upgrade to 240hz? :p
19:04:24 <DoT`> i would say unnecessary
19:06:14 <DuB`> Cheapest one is $250
19:16:08 <DuB`> Why are 1080s more than 2080s >:T
19:16:29 <DoT`> have you googled it?
19:16:36 <DoT`> could be issues with the 2080 range
19:16:45 <Runbunny> .tell reification https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/3555603
19:17:14 <Runbunny> Did you get scammed Dub?
19:17:32 <DuB`> Well I haven't bought anything, so probably not :P
19:18:25 <Runbunny> Why make a monitor which can do something that the physical ports on it doesn't support?
19:18:43 <DuB`> DVI does 144hz
19:18:53 <Runbunny> That like getting 16 gb of ram and running a 32bit OS
19:19:08 <DuB`> But the 2070 and 2080s which I'm shopping for only do hdmi2 or displayport, no dvi
19:19:26 <DuB`> My monitor has dvi and hdmi1.4
19:19:42 <Runbunny> Isn't there transformers for that stuff?
19:20:34 <DuB`> Active ones that can do high fps are apparently expensive
19:22:21 <DuB`> Yeah $100+
19:25:37 <DuB`> I guess
19:25:42 <DoT`> CockRoach https://imgur.com/gallery/Ul5QLu4
19:26:08 <DuB`> As it stands right now I could get 2070 + new monitor for the same price as a 1080, so that's at the top of my list for now
19:28:07 <skrma> hey dub can you do dvi to display port though?
19:28:41 <DuB`> Isn't that what runbun just said
19:28:53 <DuB`> The high-fps converters cost nearly as much as a monitor
19:30:52 <skrma> just do 60hz gaming like its 2007 then
19:31:01 <DuB`> I have been this week :P
19:31:15 <DuB`> 60fps overwatch makes me motion sick now lol

19:34:18 <DuB`> But my expenses are really pretty minimal besides rent, so it should be fiiiiine

19:40:35 <DuB`> Still don't know WHY the 1070 toasted itself, which is a worry...
19:41:17 <skrma> it was too hot, DuB`
19:41:56 <DuB`> o dang
19:43:44 <DoT`> do you ever clean your pc fans?
19:44:09 <DuB`> Ya I just compressed air once in a while
19:44:17 <DoT`> do you open the case?
19:44:28 <DoT`> or just spray in through the grates?
19:44:33 <DuB`> Ya
19:44:35 <DuB`> Is ez open
19:44:45 <DoT`> well your not completly hopeless
19:46:26 <DoT`> how do you know it tostaed itself?
19:47:00 <DuB`> Russian guy opened it up and said it looked like it'd been overheating for quite some time
19:47:06 <DuB`> Dunno what he saw exactly
19:47:35 <DoT`> im a bit rusty but i have no idea how anyone would tell that
19:47:39 <DoT`> unless there was a smell
19:48:08 <DoT`> but you would have noticed overhot pc smell when you opened the case
19:48:54 <DuB`> Um he said something about the state of thermal paste and some other parts, I dunno
19:49:12 <DoT`> he removed your CPU?
19:49:27 <DoT`> and this isnt 1995, thermal paste unless cheap should last for years
19:49:37 <DuB`> No, stuff within the gpu. I think??
19:49:39 <DuB`> I unno mang
19:50:08 <DoT`> well if there was an issue with thermal paste your gpu would have been overheating
19:51:11 <DoT`> thermal paste is what conductes the heat from the card to the cooling metal bits that surround the fans
19:51:27 <DoT`> it use to dry out every so often and not conduct heat
19:54:36 -!- BioPhone [~androirc@12.33.239.117] has joined #tlponies
19:57:01 <DuB`> Well unless there's something horribly wrong with mobo or psu I would hope it's not a issue after replacing it, right?
20:00:03 <DoT`> im really lazy and dont monitor my pc temp, even though i should becuase graphics cards fans are pretty broken
20:00:28 <DoT`> but will try find out whats a good program for temp monitoring
20:00:53 <DoT`> just so you can keep an eye on it and see if its an issue
20:01:12 <DoT`> though at least PC's beep loudly and turn off if they ever get really really hot
20:01:13 <DuB`> I see lots of reference to the MSI afterburner
20:01:48 <DoT`> you where overcloking?
20:01:55 <DuB`> nu
20:01:59 <DoT`> ok good
20:02:05 <DoT`> got a bit worried there
20:02:06 <DuB`> I meant that people mention it often for looking at temps
20:02:30 <skrma> Ive seen it happen before actually, bad thermal paste from factory
20:02:48 <skrma> just look at the onboard temp transmitters every now and then and it should be fine
20:02:52 <skrma> also set fan speeds to auto
20:03:18 <DoT`> yea, thats why i suggested dub get a program that he can easly check the temps
20:03:27 <DoT`> most ppl dont check system temps
20:03:53 <DuB`> Sure
20:08:06 <DoT`> gl dubs, but i agree with skram, bad factory thermal paste is very possible
20:08:24 <DuB`> Lasted about a year
20:08:45 <DoT`> PSU fauls would show with failed startups/freezing/random restarts
20:08:55 <DoT`> faults*
20:09:11 <DuB`> None o that
20:11:04 <DoT`> and motherboards ive mainly seen fail outright with things like expanded capacitors
20:11:19 <DoT`> thats normaly caused by the power supply dying and taking it with it
20:11:44 <DuB`> Everything is working quite smoothly with the gpu disabled, so probly good
20:11:47 <DoT`> mb issues are normaly very obvious, bluescreens and freezing
20:12:00 <DoT`> so yea, no need to worry about the other parts
20:12:25 <DuB`> Though things seemed weird and slow when I took it out completely, but that might've been just me doing too much at once
