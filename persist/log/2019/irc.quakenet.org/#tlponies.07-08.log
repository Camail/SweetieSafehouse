00:00:47 <DoT|Phone1> I'm disappointed in HK WiFi
00:01:22 <Zounds> u in asia dot

00:01:34 <skram> u big weeb, u
00:01:37 <Zounds> im jelly ive ever been
00:01:44 <DoT|Phone1> for about 2 more hours
00:01:54 <DoT|Phone1> then another 9 hour flight
00:02:00 <Zounds> the area I live in is about 95% HK chinese
00:02:11 <Zounds> I am the only white guy
00:02:21 <skram> do you live in the glaswegian chinatown
00:02:25 <Zounds> I do#
00:02:34 <skram> neat
00:02:38 <DoT|Phone1> Skram we should visit
00:02:56 <skram> sounds great
00:03:00 <DoT|Phone1> you can be a Weeb without going all the way to Asia
00:03:19 <Zounds> The food smells terrible but is not so bad
00:04:01 <skram> well ive never had dumplings so maybe we should go to zounds' pad and eat some Dot
00:04:25 <skram> and get one of those fruits that smell like death apparently
00:05:01 <Zounds> I am friendly with my neighbours and they eat terrible smelling but not that bad food all the time
00:05:31 <skram> I am only familiar with food that smells terrible but also tastes terrible
00:05:58 <DoT|Phone1> I had dumplings once. I wasn't a fan
00:06:09 <DoT|Phone1> might have just been bad dumplings
00:06:14 <Kittybunny> DoT|Phone1, https://clips.twitch.tv/TrappedPlacidGalagoDoggo
00:06:20 <Kittybunny> This just happened.
00:06:24 <Zounds> When I moved here my neighbour bake me red bean paste cakes that I hated but also very much appreciated
00:07:38 <skram> sounds like good people, zounds
00:07:51 <Zounds> that neighbour also practices violin about 99% of every day which is kinda annoying but I somehow remain not mad about
00:08:11 <DoT|Phone1> haha Runbun. I was expecting the reset instead of load right after that
00:09:21 <skram> my neighbour is somehow surprised that he can hear other people in the same complex and is angry at me for walking around in my own apartment
00:10:06 <Zounds> that sounds like my old place
00:10:28 <DoT|Phone1> that sounds like me
00:10:50 <Zounds> I'm way more comfy surrounded by HK chinese that don't like to speak english than I was surrounded by my fellow glaswegian
00:11:24 <Zounds> though the chinese guys are also glaswegian technically they're a bit less alcoholic/heroin addicted than average

00:12:57 <skram> its a big boy city, DoT|Phone
00:13:03 <DoT|Phone> I thought it was pizza
00:13:11 <Zounds> naw ice cream is right
00:13:36 <DoT|Phone> right. because pizza vans are not a thing
00:13:40 <Zounds> i'm a bit hyperbolic dot but although i love my city I also hate everything about it

16:12:41 <Runbunny> O:
16:12:56 <Runbunny> Make it work Dub!
16:20:40 <DuB`> how do
16:39:55 <Runbunny> Hmm.
16:40:46 <Runbunny> Describe your trials and tribulations again. 
16:41:50 <DuB`> I can't open the wf launcher through steam or the actual app files, I click and nothing happens. No processes in task manager, nothin
16:44:06 <Runbunny> Run as administrator.
16:44:12 <DuB`> Done did
16:44:16 <Runbunny> Run steam as administrator.
16:44:24 <DuB`> o
16:44:52 <Runbunny> You had some troubles with your gfx card as well right?
16:45:20 <DuB`> It is ded, yes
16:45:27 <DuB`> No change with steam as admin
16:45:57 <Runbunny> How strong is your on board thing?
16:46:08 <Runbunny> check dxdiag for that.
16:46:20 <DuB`> Decently, runs OW at 60fps when 50% render scale
16:48:36 <DuB`> Um intel uhd 630
16:49:47 <Runbunny> Memory my boy. How much is there?
16:50:56 <Runbunny> Also what OS are you running?
16:50:58 <DuB`> ram?
16:51:30 <DuB`> win10, 16gb ram
16:54:52 <Runbunny> You should be able to play it.
16:54:58 <DuB`> Yes
16:55:04 <Runbunny> Maybe restarting pc?
16:55:14 <Runbunny> Rub Dot for good luck.
16:55:33 <DuB`> Been trying all week, lotsa restarts :P
16:55:49 <Runbunny> Ah okay.
16:56:11 <DuB`> Uninstalled everything, reinstalled, verified game whatever etc
16:58:33 <Runbunny> Yes. do you use discord overlay?
16:58:49 <DuB`> I think it's on
16:59:42 <DuB`> No change with it disabled
17:01:36 <Runbunny> Do you have Nvidia physx or whatever it's called?
17:03:15 <DuB`> Don think so
17:05:11 <Runbunny> https://www.nvidia.com/object/physx-9.18.0907-driver.html
17:05:54 <Runbunny> Don't know if that is the newest one, but some guy had a similar problem and he installed that and it went away.
17:06:09 <DuB`> O I do, "newer or same version is present"
17:06:20 <Runbunny> Hmm.
17:06:27 <Runbunny> You tried this right? https://steamcommunity.com/app/230410/discussions/0/2381701715713779887/?ctp=1
17:12:06 <Runbunny> Also did you set the warframe.exe or the launcher.exe as run as administrator?
17:15:14 <DuB`> Tried both
17:15:36 <DuB`> Running in Windows XP compatibility at least makes the launcher start, but gives "You have old OS" error lol
17:19:12 <Runbunny> Yeah, you need 64.
17:19:57 <Runbunny> So the process actually starts but it just crash instantly I guess.

17:21:56 <Runbunny> Try closing discord and running the game.
17:24:12 <DuB`> Nuffin
17:25:24 <Runbunny> Launch it from discord.
17:25:32 <Camail> did you verify game files in steam
17:25:35 <Runbunny> I am grasping at straws here :/
17:25:38 <DuB`> Yes
17:25:46 <Runbunny> It doesn't work with warframe, or so I am let to believe.
17:26:22 <DuB`> Well yeah
17:26:30 <DuB`> Uninstalled and reinstalled, no verify option
17:27:35 <DuB`> Re dling and installing through discord, I guess
17:27:38 <Runbunny> You need the launcher for the verification.
17:45:19 <DuB`> Naw discord install and launch does nuffin
17:45:26 <DuB`> rip
17:50:58 <Runbunny> change the compatibility to xp and see if you can access launcher options.
17:51:11 <Runbunny> turn everything off I guess.
17:52:02 <DuB`> ooo ya
17:52:14 <DuB`> I imagine launcher gpu accel being a problem mebbe
17:52:46 <DuB`> Ooooh
17:53:11 <DuB`> Hurray :D
17:53:57 <DuB`> What a silly thing -- have to start launcher in incompatible mode just so you can get the error message which allows you to access the launcher's actual options to turn off the thing breaking it
17:53:59 <DuB`> Ayaya
17:58:02 <Runbunny> It fixed it?

19:03:11 <BioPone> A bit, but I finished it and the build doesn't start until aug
19:03:30 <BioPone> But I do have a meeting soon
19:43:11 <Camail> skram i got my cyclone build done but i feel like it doesn't do much damage, thinking of going for the crit node for my third lab
19:43:28 <Camail> i do sooo much more damage than my ts deadeye tho so i wont need a carry
19:43:51 <Camail> apparently i'm missing an 8ex quiver that adds a lot of damage to that build...sigh
19:46:24 <skram> what would you swap out for the crit thing?
19:46:29 <skram> carnage?
19:47:36 <skram> wat that'd be 4th
19:55:58 <Camail> i wont take the overleech
19:56:12 <Camail> get bane of legends for the 20% culling
19:58:57 <Camail> i'll probably end up selling the starforge, i dont want to do pure phys
19:59:28 <Camail> if i get inspired learning i want to be able to steal the juicy damage mods
19:59:53 <skram> wait hold on when did you get a cyclone boi
20:00:03 <Camail> yesterday
20:00:07 <skram> huh
20:00:10 <skram> alright
20:00:12 <Camail> i was farming shaper and got a starforge
20:00:37 <Camail> and i already had a few neat cyclone things so it finally pushed me over the edge to make one
20:00:45 <Camail> he's only 68 atm
20:04:02 <Camail> i'm copying a HH build, but technically....infinitely worse
20:14:45 <Camail> once i get this build operational we can test out doing some legion stuff
20:15:08 <Camail> start with a 3way and if that's fast, go form there
20:15:12 <skram> double spinny boi woo
20:15:52 <Camail> we could do that with my bladestorm guy
20:16:05 <skram> its not the same brand of spinning, cam
20:16:06 <Camail> if this build works i'll be able to clear everything solo
