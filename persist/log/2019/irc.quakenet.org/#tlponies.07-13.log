02:07:39 <skram> meh im just sittin here
02:09:18 <DuB`> My favorite pastime
02:11:34 <skram> im looking forward to winter
02:11:54 <skram> that way i wont have to go to bed with the sunrise
02:12:18 <DuB`> I would be excited for winter but I dunno how good my heater is gonna be 
02:12:36 <skram> blankets are cheap
02:12:40 <skram> and cozy
02:15:13 <DuB`> I got $100 to spend on on company merch 
02:15:25 <DuB`> So far I've ordered 4 mugs for hot cocoa I guess
02:15:37 <skram> company merch..??
02:15:43 <DuB`> Just branded random stuff
02:15:51 <skram> thats so weird
02:15:56 <DuB`> Also an umbrella cause I don have one
02:16:29 <DuB`> I could've gotten 50 bags of lil gummy bears with the company logo on them :P
02:16:44 <Camail> word of mouth is the easiest kind of advertisement if you make good hoodies for your employees
02:16:58 <Camail> walking billboards
02:17:18 <DuB`> Joke's on them I'mma sip from my mug riiiiight here
02:17:23 <skram> I dont think i'd want anything with the company logo on it outside of work honestly
02:18:12 <Camail> eh, if it's a small logo and a legit coat or something, i wouldn't mind
02:18:31 <Camail> it let's you not wear a collared shirt but still look like you work somewhere
02:19:13 <DuB`> Nice lil logo https://preview.thenewsmarket.com/Previews/PWC/StillAssets/196567_v2.jpg
02:19:21 <Camail> pvvc
02:19:36 <DuB`> I surely don't care if that's up on top of my umbrella somewhere
02:19:47 <Camail> gasp
02:19:54 <Camail> you work for a british company
02:19:57 <Camail> how could you
02:20:08 <Camail> i thought you were A PATRIOT
02:20:17 <DuB`> Akshually
02:20:50 <DuB`> Companies in this industry are so tightly regulated that the branch in each country is completely independent
02:21:08 <Camail> that's what benedict arnold said
02:21:11 <DuB`> So my company is 100% usa legally/owned etc
02:21:21 <Camail> RIGHT before he killed lincoln
02:21:24 <DuB`> Haha
02:21:25 <Camail> ya commie
02:22:55 <skram> I have a jacket with they Hydro logo on it (where I used to work) that I sometimes wear, and they're apparently destroying brazil these days
02:22:56 <skram> good times

19:07:08 <motbob> unfortunately, where I live, the delivery fee is always $5, so meh
19:07:43 <motbob> they don't put the most value items on the ubereats menu so it's just better to drive out yourself and order
19:12:07 <DuB`> $3 delivery fee for most things here, so it takes care of that and the service fee and a lil, pretty good
