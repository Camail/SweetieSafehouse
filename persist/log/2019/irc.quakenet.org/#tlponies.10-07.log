18:13:17 <Camail> so i'd thought to put the question to you
18:14:07 <Dot`> nah, i know it was just an offer, if it starts to get near the end of the leauge and im struggling i may take you up on it
18:14:34 <Dot`> but would rather see how far i can get before i need it
18:25:47 <Rawr|Phone> I believe in you dot
