11:54:52 <skram> does your bossman know
11:55:18 <Dot|Phone> Yea 
11:56:09 <skram> good good
11:56:23 <Dot|Phone> My headache continues, I think the window above my bed isn't sealed right so I get cold air on my head all night

11:56:48 <skram> hmm
11:56:57 <skram> get some window sealer gasket maybe?
11:56:57 <Dot|Phone> So just a bit grouchy in general today
12:01:00 <Dot|Phone> But I also kinda want to play a tabaxi eldritch knight on dnd atm. So I got that to ponder on, which is nice
12:01:45 <skram> why not an elephant perosn

12:02:08 <Dot|Phone> Hey runbun
12:02:15 <skram> And ers.
12:03:18 <Dot|Phone> Elephant doesn't really grab my attention currently
12:03:44 <Dot|Phone> It was either tabaxi or human and I already have a human character in playing
12:04:20 <skram> why not a dwarf
12:05:00 <Dot|Phone> A dwarf with magic? Heresy
12:05:36 <skram> its ok i think
12:06:08 <skram> eldritch knight is mostly a knight
12:06:28 <Dot|Phone> I'll save dorf for if I ever play a barb 
12:07:50 <Dot|Phone> A barb that doesn't rage, he just gets disappointed
12:08:11 <skram> perfect

19:56:03 <Runbunny> Camail, the golden pickle event is apparently increased streamstones. or whatever the augment material is called.
19:56:23 <Camail> yea, there are a few that say that
19:56:38 <Camail> but also, purple boxes are waited towards that too
19:56:45 <Runbunny> Pickle hits hard though.
19:56:54 <Camail> i recall the general consensus just being investigations
