12:31:32 <DoT|Phone1> I'm feeling trolled Reif. a south African friend of mine claims to not know what Yorkshire is....
12:31:40 <DoT|Phone1> he lives in England
12:34:02 <reification> lolwat
12:34:38 <reification> that seems very unlikely dot
12:35:04 <DoT|Phone1> I know. but he seems serious and it's not his kind of joke
12:35:20 <DoT|Phone1> I'm very concerned
12:35:37 <reification> has he never had yorkshire puddings?
12:35:51 <DoT|Phone1> I mentioned Yorkshire
12:36:07 <DoT|Phone1> and he said "is that the same as York"
12:37:00 <reification> uh he should be familiar with the common shire county ending...
12:37:50 <DoT|Phone1> that's an English thing
12:38:52 <reification> yes but he lives here no?
12:39:51 <DoT|Phone1> down south in Guilford
12:41:12 <reification> we still have hampshire and wiltshire and berkshire and buckinghamshire and oxfordshire etc
12:43:07 <reification> the only uk place without "shires" is northern ireland

16:09:28 <Camail> Runbunny i'm putting my items up for alchs, i'm so starved
16:09:34 <DoT|Phone1> horses are easily spooked
16:09:46 <Camail> luckily we only have 1 horse
16:09:48 <Camail> and he's not here
16:10:27 <Runbunny> O:
16:10:35 <Runbunny> You alch'ing maps?
16:10:46 <Runbunny> or what do you spent them on?

16:16:25 <Camail> yea
16:16:34 <Camail> but alchs aren't dropping at all
16:16:50 <Camail> or maybe i'm just unlucky
16:16:54 <Runbunny> Hmm.
16:17:15 <Runbunny> I know they adjusted the drop chance a few patches ago.
16:17:51 <Camail> i think its because blight isn't dropping as many as legion did
16:18:06 <Camail> blight drops are pretty bad
16:18:14 <Camail> but you still need them to self sustain
16:18:59 <Camail> also, i bought a corrupted amulet, forgot you cant anoint them, and resold it >_>
