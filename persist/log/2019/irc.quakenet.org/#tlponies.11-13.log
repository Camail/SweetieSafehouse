18:04:41 <Dot`> reif D: glad he is ok
18:04:57 <Dot`> you should cover the bathroom in foam mats
18:06:03 <reification> then it could happen somewhere else, the solution is clearly to cover him in foam mats
18:06:41 <reification> i did see some company working on personal airbags for fall prone ppl a while ago
18:07:39 <Dot`> sounds like a plan
