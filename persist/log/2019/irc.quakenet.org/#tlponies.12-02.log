10:45:29 <Dot|Phone> Sounds like what a sleep typer would say
10:56:37 <Runbunny> Hmm.
10:57:56 <Runbunny> So you're saying that in my sleep, I have turned on my pc, logged on, opened up IRC and connected to the right servers, and typing to you right now?
10:59:00 <Dot|Phone> All I have is the evidence in front of me
11:01:46 <Runbunny> I probably wouldn't dream that my thighs are sore. :/

13:33:33 <skram> i spent most of the day BAKING with my mum

15:11:59 <Dot|Phone> Where are these cute cats that wonder in the woods
15:12:10 <Runbunny> Norway.
15:13:44 <carcinisation> we should go there and investigate
15:13:51 <Dot|Phone> Indeed
15:14:30 <carcinisation> also i think i have won my extended battle with apple tech support
15:14:45 <carcinisation> even if they were a bit tsundere about it
15:14:52 <Dot|Phone> You changed to windows? 
15:15:46 <carcinisation> this was over an apple watch dot, i use both windows and osx
15:16:06 <Dot|Phone> Oh right, you do
15:16:37 <carcinisation> i may have won the watch, intended to sell it like i did some of the other stuff i won, and left it in a box for 3 years...
15:16:54 <Dot|Phone> Haha
15:17:09 <Dot|Phone> Winning to many things
15:17:12 <Dot|Phone> Too
15:17:34 <Dot|Phone> Can't keep track of them all
15:17:47 <carcinisation> then when i got it out it wouldn't sync to my phone because it was so out of date and the first step to updating it is... sync to phone :/
15:18:05 <Dot|Phone> Well that's troublesome
15:19:01 <Runbunny> lel.
15:19:46 <Runbunny> It's like the "If you have trouble with your internet and can't connect, send us an email"
15:19:47 <carcinisation> and because basically no-one is going to do what i did, it's a nice obscure case to get fixed
15:19:50 <Runbunny> Like how ?!?
15:25:53 <carcinisation> and then when i did send it in i got an email the same day saying they couldn't fix it 
15:26:01 <carcinisation> "Your product arrived at our repair center, but our technicians weren't able to process your repair request. Weâ€™re sending the product to you along with a letter that provides more information."
15:26:40 <carcinisation> then when it arrives back now and i try it just in case it only bloody works
15:28:40 <Runbunny> Dot|Phone, Rawr|Phone https://i.imgur.com/fYBdUzy.mp4
15:29:29 <carcinisation> https://twitter.com/TheSun/status/1201325109153271809
15:29:57 <Runbunny> Well apple repair centers are pretty notorious for not being able to fix their stuff, they just want you to buy a new product.
15:30:13 <Runbunny> Some guy made a youtube channel about it.
15:30:41 <skram> isnt diy-ing apple stuff illegal
15:31:14 <carcinisation> skram have some high art https://twitter.com/JoPeiper/status/1199987097442107392
15:31:38 <carcinisation> also the life of a horse https://twitter.com/EuropeanHighArt/status/1200901823638441986
15:31:43 <skram> magnificent
15:32:30 <Runbunny> I believe there are legal cases ongoing as we speak Jonas.
15:33:07 <Runbunny> But they did sue a norwegian guy for fixing iphone screens.
15:33:36 <skram> indeed
15:33:45 <skram> youtube apple repair lad had some trouble too I think
15:36:51 <Runbunny> Yeah :/
