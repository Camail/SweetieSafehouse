00:12:45 <Camail> Runbunny immortal syndicate safehouse leaders offer their bonus twice, right
00:13:00 <DuB`> I do, skram
00:14:23 <skram> You're a big boi in the big city, now
00:15:10 <DuB`> Everyone needs a good country nordman to keep them grounded
00:16:15 <skram> ill smack you down with some country wisdom when you get too big for your breeches
00:18:33 <Bio> something something country roads
00:19:32 <skram> you ever get that feeling
00:19:43 <skram> that you should have been home yesterday?
00:19:46 <skram> yesterdaaaaayyyyyyyy?
00:22:28 <Runbunny> I think they buffed it Camail.
00:22:33 <Runbunny> But I am uncertain.
00:22:35 <Camail> i answered my own question
00:22:39 <Camail> the leader gets it twice
00:22:50 <Camail> i got two chayula's pure breachstones to flip
00:23:26 <Camail> solid 2ex profit from that, plus a 50c profit from 2 white socket prismatic edge
00:23:54 <Camail> my ed/con's betrayal is set up perfectly....meanwhile the others are a fuckin mess
