06:44:26 <skram> theres so many things wrong in this picture
06:45:09 <DoT`> is it time for the best part of dota tournies?? the hero pixcking

06:47:50 <Golly> y
06:50:58 <skram> oh no
06:51:02 <skram> they have the tiny, DoT`
06:51:31 <skram> OG needs to win so we can have the TL v OG grand finals
06:51:36 <DoT`> good start
06:51:53 <DoT`> og doesnt have the tiny though
06:52:04 <skram> no thats why i went oh no
06:52:45 <Golly> elder titan has been really good as well
06:52:54 <skram> for sure
06:56:50 <DoT`> og need tree or enchantress
06:58:00 <skram> ooh
06:58:06 <skram> sword waifu, dot!

07:19:23 <DoT`> tell me it will be ok
07:19:30 <skram> it'll be alright buddy
07:19:32 <Rawr|Fone> Probably won't
07:20:05 <DoT`> snela
07:21:33 <DoT`> oh dear
07:21:36 <Rawr|Fone> It's pretty much a lost game at this point I think
07:22:23 <skram> alch isnt fat enough to deal with LGDs cores probably
07:22:59 <skram> oh no
07:24:27 <Rawr|Fone> And topson and ceb are very underfarmed
07:24:49 <Rawr|Fone> If it wasn't for inflated alch networth they would be very far behind 
07:25:39 <DoT`> well thast something
07:29:21 <DoT`> rawr you have to believe
07:29:21 <Rawr|Fone> That is a great way to get backin the game
07:30:30 <DoT`> rawr i need you to go back to thinking they will lose
07:30:35 <skram> hahah
07:30:38 <DoT`> then they can win
07:31:00 <Rawr|Fone> I think it will still take a lot for them to win
07:31:12 <DoT`> thats the way rawr
07:31:20 <Rawr|Fone> I don't think they are ahead even with the rax kills
07:32:40 <skram> right now they probably are but they need to win before tiny/slark becomes too big
07:37:20 <DoT`> scary
07:37:57 <Rawr|Fone> Topson and ceb are too far behind I think
07:39:07 <DoT`> good rawr
07:40:58 <Rawr|Fone> If they can use this aegis, then there's a chance
07:42:58 <DoT`> THEY DOING THING
07:43:07 <DoT`> GG
07:43:19 <skram> jesus
07:43:51 <skram> i think that was so much closer than it seemed
07:44:48 <Rawr|Fone> Og got rosh twice in a row in a position where they probably shouldn't
07:45:06 <Rawr|Fone> And then they won team fights they probably shouldn't as well
07:45:23 <skram> thats just OG in a nutshell though
07:45:30 <Rawr|Fone> Pretty much
07:45:34 <Rawr|Fone> Comeback kings
07:45:35 <skram> they always seem to get away with more than they should
07:46:11 <Rawr|Fone> Lose early, win late

21:34:01 <Runbunny> So all you'd have to do is stall for 50 min and then you win the game?
