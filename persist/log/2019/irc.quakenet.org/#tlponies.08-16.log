07:47:34 <Rawr|Phone> I have to sort through the archives of every note they have made about words in the swedish language
07:47:49 <Rawr|Phone> The oldest ones are from like 500 years ago
07:51:25 <DoT|Phone> that is interesting indeed!
07:51:41 <DoT|Phone> any particular good ones so far?
08:10:30 <Rawr|Phone> Mostly people disagreeing on what to call new things dot
08:10:38 <DoT|Phone> haha
08:10:43 <Rawr|Phone> Airplanes are called "flygplan" in swedish
08:10:58 <Rawr|Phone> But many people called them "vingflygare"
08:11:05 <Rawr|Phone> Which means wingflyer
08:11:48 <DoT|Phone> and flygplan translates as?
08:13:09 <Rawr|Phone> Flyplane I guess
