19:20:02 <DuB`> No but I shall
19:21:28 <skram> it peaks at episode 3 or so
19:23:11 <Dot`> so only watch till then
19:23:17 <Zounds> you can use baptiste immortality field to block doomfist punches aswell reification if you're looking for obscure tips
19:23:34 <Zounds> the time between throwing it and it activating it's immune to damage but still blocks the punch
19:23:57 <reification> ooh that's nifty
19:27:03 <Zounds> one I've thought about but haven't actually tried is putting mei wall through an enemy baptiste immortality field
19:27:40 <Zounds> I think it would block the line of sight on the field so they could die but I haven't had the opportunity to try
19:28:09 <Zounds> not really sure if it gets lifted up or sits inside the wall :P
19:28:25 <Zounds> or if that would even matter, cause how big is the range vertically?
19:31:10 <reification> i think it should work, it's not that high
