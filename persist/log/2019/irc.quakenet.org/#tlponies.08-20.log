20:34:25 <DuB|fon> My latest pangs of silicon addiction have me wondering if I should just ditch my troublesome 250gb sata ssd for a fancy 1tb m.2 nvme one...
20:35:46 <skram> the answer
20:35:47 <skram> is yes
20:36:32 <skram> Just build a NAS out of SSDs
20:37:51 <DoT`> just store your OS on a cloud
20:37:57 <DuB|fon> Uh
20:38:15 <DuB|fon> I dunno if bios has "cloud" as a boot drive
20:38:33 <DoT`> good point, put your bios on one too
20:38:39 <Runbunny> Just write your OS when you boot.
20:38:51 <skram> just run BASIC
20:38:58 <DoT`> then your almost as bad off as using linux runbun
20:39:11 <Runbunny> dot...
20:39:20 <Runbunny> Linux has a penguin. 
20:39:29 <DuB|fon> They do call it cloud computing
20:39:37 <DuB|fon> I'll just upload my whole pc
20:39:37 <DoT`> its one redeeming feature runbun
20:39:45 <skram> I dont think you can run overwatch on a thin client?
20:40:03 <DoT`> not with that attitude skram
20:40:33 <skram> just remove the whole interface, start setting bits manually
20:40:37 <skram> real immersive experience

20:42:29 <DuB|fon> I cant wait
20:43:13 <DoT`> is it still that song if nothing about it is the same?
20:43:21 <DuB|fon> Btw how easy is it to move OS between drives
20:43:32 <DuB|fon> Ctrl c ctrl v? :D
20:43:37 <DoT`> yes
20:43:39 <skram> uuh
20:43:40 <DoT`> then after that
20:43:42 <DoT`> reinstall
20:43:47 <DuB|fon> o
20:43:51 <skram> i dont know if you can haha
20:43:59 <DoT`> it takes about 2 minutes to install windows on an ssd
20:44:12 <Camail> i dont think you can move your os
20:44:36 <DoT`> if you clone the drive you can
20:44:37 <skram> ask uncle google, dub
20:44:41 <DoT`> otherwise no
20:44:52 <DuB|fon> Hmm hmm
20:45:03 <skram> but theres probably tools around for that, but its probably the same or more work as doing a fresh install
20:45:06 <Camail> when will dub's frankencomputer be done
20:45:11 <Camail> i cant imagine the stress it's under
20:45:13 <DuB|fon> Haha
20:45:36 <skram> besides, you cant beat that fresh windows smell
20:46:02 <DuB|fon> Speaking of, looking around at builds and parts for so long has made me hate my ugly case and now I want to redo EVERYTHING
20:46:22 <DoT`> cases are expensive
20:46:33 <DuB|fon> Get one o those big ones you can put a million fans in
