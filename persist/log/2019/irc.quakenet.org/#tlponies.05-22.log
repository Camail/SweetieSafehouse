18:09:03 <Camail> cuz that's better than "run till my lungs burn"
18:10:55 <Camail> any time i've started to exercise after about 2 weeks i get sick because i maintain my terrible life style while also being way more tired
18:11:19 <Camail> then i feel too sick to work out and boom, forget completely 
18:24:19 <DuB`> Ye I have a nice rotation of stuff, always just overdo it in the moment

18:38:56 <DuB`> To advance quests and talk to npcs
18:39:07 <DuB`> Requirements: be sociable
18:39:38 <Camail> yea instead of wasting time TPing to town and back
18:48:55 <Camail> wait no, i realize i didnt do sprinter
