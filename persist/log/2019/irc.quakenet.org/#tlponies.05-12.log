11:35:07 <Dot`> Hey zounds!
11:35:10 <Runbunny> I went to the store, to get some stuff and when I came home I noticed my phone was like "How was the store?" from google maps.
11:35:21 <Runbunny> and here I am just thinking, maybe don't spy on me?
11:35:25 <Dot`> yea mine does that too
11:35:40 <Dot`> it also goes " you havnt been here in X months"
11:36:10 <Runbunny> Mine used to be like "Shortest way home is this" and it was to some random location.

13:28:58 <Zounds> my ffxiv experience distilled into a single image
13:31:10 <Runbunny> The very commanding swaying of the arms while walking is very authoritative though.
13:32:27 <Zounds> The choice was between giant strides or really quick steps to keep us on our marks in cutscenes I guess

14:46:35 <Runbunny> Zounds, Luckily they made the bad dragon black and the good dragon white.
14:46:42 <Runbunny> I was confused there for a moment.
14:48:37 <Zounds> I don't think that's a hard and fast rule there's various dragons of good and bad variety of different colours
14:49:03 <skram> black dragons are always evil, zounds
14:55:37 <Zounds> most dragons are sorta brown
14:55:41 <Zounds> with some yellow ones and blue ones
14:57:49 <Zounds> Though now that I think about it they do call Hraesvelgr "White Wyrm" and Nidhogg "Black Wyrm" so maybe they were going for the obvious thing
14:58:43 <skram> nidhogg is literally a worm trying to end the world
14:58:51 <skram> if there was any doubt to the evilness
15:00:14 <Zounds> Yeh
15:00:50 <Zounds> FF does seem to rip off the names of mythological creatures without much care for what they originally were though
15:01:46 <skram> well he is sorta dragon-y i guess
15:01:59 <skram> dont think norse mythology had actual dragons but they had like wyrms and things
15:02:12 <Zounds> There's an Odin and it does ride Sleipnir
15:02:21 <Zounds> but mostly just rides around a forest fighting people
15:04:53 <Zounds> Cool thing about the world boss version of odin though is he takes the appearance of the last guy who got the killing blow on him
15:05:14 <Zounds> so you can have a whole bunch of people trying to beat up something that looks like you
15:06:50 <Runbunny> Midgårdsormen Skram.
15:12:22 <skram> yeh he's the evil one surrounding midgard
15:12:33 <skram> nidhogg is tryna eat yggdrasil
15:12:44 <skram> and theres a squirrel shouting rude words at it
15:14:11 <Zounds> ratatoskr was the squirrel I think
15:14:15 <Zounds> fun god to play in SMITE
15:14:30 <skram> yarp
15:15:34 <Zounds> I'm pretty sure there's a ratatoskr mentioned in ffxiv but he's not a squirrel
15:16:21 <Runbunny> It was mentions
15:20:40 <Runbunny> mentioned*
15:21:29 <Runbunny> like recently to where I am in the story.
