18:23:18 <DuB`> Was gonna go level in new d3 season and ask if anyone wanted to join, but...
18:23:33 <DuB`> Apparently they are starting this one on a rolling schedule, 5pm wherever you are
18:23:38 <DuB`> So I don't have it yet!
18:24:07 <Camail> lul
18:24:08 <DuB`> I wanted to pley all day but now I stoody :T
18:24:44 <Camail> rolling schedules seem kinda dumb
18:25:07 <DuB`> Guess they wanted to avoid euros who wanted to rush for leaderboards etc not have to stay up all night
18:25:07 <Camail> well i have time to patch at least
18:25:52 <Camail> yea so now they let people in russia have a few hours of a head start
18:26:18 <Camail> it's restricting races to time zones, which is the worse of the two options
18:26:32 <DuB`> troo
18:26:59 <Camail> oh, t14-16 are a thing
18:27:08 <Camail> doesn't super matter, other than getting resources faster late game
18:27:51 <Camail> good end game chars can make speedrun builds for  gr75 without too much issue
18:29:15 <Camail> oh shit they added a search bar lul
18:29:20 <Camail> please take more things from poe
18:29:27 <Camail> its not like it's as useful int his game tho
18:32:06 <Camail> they're trying to make WD poison darts a thing, neat
18:32:38 <Camail> oh shit sage's set bonus
18:32:49 <Camail> they are upping the DB drop rate massively this season
18:32:57 <Camail> maybe because it was so ass
18:35:54 <DuB`> Now we can JUST rift :P
18:36:01 <DuB`> And more bounties this time, I guess
18:36:30 <Camail> bounties drop DBs so yea
18:36:51 <Camail> and we dont have shitty bounties where we have to run around the map for 2 minutes
18:45:51 <Camail> my hand feels like garbage to day tho, so i'll try but if there's a 5th wanting to play they can replace me

18:48:58 <Runbunny> How long till the thing starts Dub?
18:49:18 <DuB`> Should have started for you
18:50:34 <Runbunny> Oh.
18:55:46 <Runbunny> What is the gimmick this time Dub?
18:56:27 <Camail> the unset is implicit
18:56:32 <Camail> litany
18:56:44 <DuB`> Permanent legacy of nightmares effect, which is the rings which give the buff for not using set items
18:58:16 <Runbunny> So you're crazy strong when not using set items?
18:58:45 <Camail> gotta use ancients, tho
18:58:55 <DuB`> Ye ye
18:58:57 <Camail> so lots of grinding and the power curce is more sporadic
18:59:02 <Camail> curve*
18:59:18 <DuB`> Oh I don't have the game dled lul
18:59:19 <Camail> before it was first set> top tier set> optimized top tier set
18:59:21 <DuB`> Gogo 16gb
18:59:37 <DuB`> Could do this in 30 min if I was still at uni apartment!
18:59:48 <Camail> but with lon its first set> something else> critical mass of ancients
19:01:14 <Runbunny> lel.
19:05:47 <Camail> dunno which class i want to play, tb
19:05:56 <Camail> h
19:07:03 <Runbunny> random.org
19:07:16 <Camail> nah, it's not tha ti want to play multiple
19:07:24 <Runbunny> Choose list randomizer and write every class in.
19:07:29 <Camail> it's that i dont particularly want to play any so i need to figure out what i want
19:07:42 <Runbunny> I say skip then.
19:08:00 <Camail> this is my process
19:08:12 <Camail> i dont plan on going hard, either way

20:31:09 <Dot> he cares
20:31:35 <DuB`> Oh, d3 season start isn't full rolling-time like the article I read suggested, just 5pm pst for NA and 5pm cest for EU
20:35:28 <Camail> ah, makes much more sense
20:35:34 <Camail> thats still really late =/
