08:14:51 <DuB`> oops
08:15:18 <Dot> oh :/ is it ok?
08:15:19 <Runbunny> A screw broke off from somewhere and the one of the connections between the screen and the bottom is busted.
08:15:25 <Runbunny> I did still work.
08:15:27 <DuB`> D:
08:15:47 <Runbunny> But it's like open in the lower left part of the screen.

08:24:22 <Dot> is the TI ever going to start?
08:24:44 <Runbunny> No.
08:25:05 <DuB`> Gotta wait for the china timezone to sync up with ours
08:25:14 <Runbunny> there was even a 1Â½ hour delay due to technical difficulties at like 4 am.

09:26:53 <Cane> Now they get to play from behind the rest of the game.
09:27:03 <Cane> OG has the lategame comp.
09:28:32 <Rawr|Phone> Great to hear
09:33:40 <Cane> This is just over.

10:19:54 <skram> did they get too horny for teamfights and forgot the objectives for a moment
10:20:10 <Golly> welcome to og vs liquid, where the there are no lanes and the towers dont matter
10:30:13 <Cane> lol
10:30:48 <Cane> The Liquid Special: Lose all the lanes, fall apart in the midgame, scramble in the lategame to take a fight and somehow win the game.
10:31:19 <Golly> idk about this one, maybe a 5man black hole could do it
10:34:55 <Cane> They got *wrecked*.
10:39:09 <Cane> LOL
10:39:23 <Cane> "Call me EnVy because I had to kick Gunnar" holy shit Tsunami
10:39:24 <skram> rude
10:39:24 <Golly> rip gunner
10:41:20 <skram> wonder what EE-sama is up to these days
10:41:44 <Cane> Losing, probably.
10:41:58 <Cane> I haven't seen him at all since Kyle called him out.
11:07:34 <Golly> hm i really wanna go to TI10 but getting tickets is gonne be rough
11:11:41 <Cane> I'm guessing scalpers are gonna be a problem again.
11:11:56 <Golly> relatively small arena too
11:12:07 <skram> depends where they put it i guess
11:12:10 <Cane> It being in Stockholm means it's hard finding excuses NOT to go, but...
11:12:23 <Cane> Tickets will probably be really expensive and it's a long event.
11:13:00 <skram> wait did they anounce the location today?
11:14:03 <Golly> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRwuH2aSCZ8
11:19:55 <skram> did TL hurt OGs feelings in game1? They seem to be out for revenge
11:20:44 <skram> Its not even about the dota anymmore, they're just  running around looking for things to punch
11:21:36 <skram> Jesus, topson is in top fuckin' form today
11:21:46 <skram> nothing at all like the last time they went to TI
11:22:19 <Cane> Topson is occasionally the best player in the world, and some times he can't even outfarm his offlaner.
11:22:26 <Cane> I guess that's what happens when you're a risktaker.
11:22:50 <skram> true
11:23:11 <skram> and sometimes he dies 9 times and still somehow comes out on top
11:23:50 <Cane> Yep. He's really the only midlaner that's happy to bash his face against your fist until your fist stops working.
11:24:30 <skram> Well he IS finnish
11:24:32 <skram> sisu and all that

14:46:57 <skram> the good stuff

15:01:37 <DoT`> are you a sparky skram?
15:01:56 <skram> used to be, dot
15:02:21 <DoT`> makes sense, didnt think what you did now sounded like a sparky job
15:03:01 <skram> its not entirely the same I guess, I studied automation at trade school which is sort of both the engineering bit and the sparky bit
15:03:46 <skram> So I'd do the schematics up, build the controls, program myself
