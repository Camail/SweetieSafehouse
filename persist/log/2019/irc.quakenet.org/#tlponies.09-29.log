17:45:03 <Bio> for skrm
17:45:51 <skrm> i disagree with this chart bio
17:46:00 <skrm> tequila isnt something you drink unless you hate yourself
17:46:28 <carcinisation> skram is right, def misplaced
17:46:53 <Bio> swap tequila w/ wine coolers and its prob ok
17:46:59 <Bio> i mostly just laughed at gin
17:49:13 <skrm> gin is ambrosia, bio
17:49:22 <skrm> its got all the vitamins you need (probably)
17:50:25 <carcinisation> surely once you start drinking gin you stop caring about things like vitamins
17:50:43 <Bio> that doesn't sound right, but i don't know enough about gin to refute you, so i begrudgingly agree.
17:50:49 <Bio> xDDDD

20:45:05 <Camail> thats 25m xp gone
20:45:14 <Dot`> ouch :(
20:45:21 <Camail> roughly 1 hours of t16 grinding
20:45:26 <Camail> which is itself hard to sustain
20:45:53 <Camail> once i hit 98 i'll be done grinding on this char tho
20:46:04 <Camail> i really really want that level
20:46:21 <Camail> whats nuts is 1-98.5 is the same amount of time as 98.5-100
20:46:33 <Camail> so i have no desire to get to 99
20:47:07 <Camail> you could get another character to like 90 before going from 98 to 99
