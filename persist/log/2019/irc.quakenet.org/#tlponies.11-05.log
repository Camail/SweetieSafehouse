15:10:03 <skram> hmm
15:10:18 <skram> im certain theres a way you can be lazy and have a burrito at the same time, micen
15:10:31 <Micen> not when i have to cook everything
15:10:59 <BioPhone> It probably has to do with food deliveries
15:11:23 <skram> do you have any easily manipulated family memebers
15:11:39 <Micen> hahaha i live so far out from anything i cant even get any pizza hut delivered. they stop a mile up the road. 
15:12:11 <Micen> none that i trust in a kitchen. my sister almost cut her finger off cutting apples into eights for dipping. 
15:12:42 <skram> they gotta learn somehow, micen
15:12:56 <skram> losing a finger is a good lesson probably
15:14:20 <Micen> i dont feel like cleaning up blood skram.

20:13:27 <Camail> yo
20:13:36 <Camail> critical role cartoon is coming to amazon prime
20:13:50 <Camail> i'm honestly not too surprised
20:14:02 <Camail> given that they got a lot of attention with the 11mil
20:14:12 <Camail> but still, adding a second season is dope as shit
20:14:52 <Dot`> thats reall cool
20:14:57 <Dot`> bunch of nerds and thier dnd
20:16:32 <Camail> its gonna be a full 12 eps per season
20:16:43 <Camail> went from 1 episode to 24
20:16:47 <Camail> i'd say thats a success
20:17:24 <skram> pretty solid
20:17:42 <skram> whats the cartoon gonna be about?
20:18:19 <skram> is it gonna be the podcast animated so to speak or is it gonna be an origins sort of thing like the comics
20:19:02 <Camail> its gonna be the briarwood arc first
20:19:07 <Camail> then...no one knows
20:19:10 <skram> oh sick
20:19:11 <Camail> i dont even think they really know
20:44:15 <Camail> so skram what weapon are you building
20:44:24 <Camail> xeno blades?
20:44:54 <skram> decimation claws
20:45:42 <Runbunny> I got my gunlance setup up and running yesterday.
20:45:49 <Runbunny> It's still pretty slow though.
20:46:38 <Camail> nice
20:46:48 <Camail> skram you should get https://monsterhunterworld.wiki.fextralife.com/Empress+Daggers+Ruin
20:47:41 <Camail> its an easy way to get health recovery
20:48:09 <Camail> otherwise you gotta farm for streamstones and gems, which is a pain when you're just getting into end game
20:48:21 <Camail> but that also means getting lunastra on farm
20:48:27 <Camail> and nergi
20:48:42 <skram> lunastra is too scary
20:49:02 <Camail> you've fought her for like 10 minutes
20:49:18 <Camail> we need to farm a  monster and get some balls for you to equip
20:49:26 <Camail> right now you have some little jagras balls
20:49:39 <Camail> you need at least legiana sized balls
20:49:51 <skram> rude
20:49:58 <skram> ...not untrue, though
20:50:30 <Camail> you have to learn when to commit to the big DPS
20:50:41 <Camail> and where you can safely stand
20:50:56 <Runbunny> Awaken your demon Jonas.
20:51:00 <Camail> for example: foreleg armpit is a very good place to stand vs the chimeras
20:51:11 <Runbunny> and then transcend to archdemon.
20:51:58 <skram> yeh
20:52:12 <skram> i feel like im just too slow on the uptake when the big dick attacks hit
20:52:21 <Camail> you get used to it
20:52:52 <Camail> the mons you've been fighting have had their AI and damage limited
20:53:25 <Camail> give it another 30 hours and you'll be good to go
