08:16:16 <Rawr|Fone> Anders.
08:16:48 <Runbunny> Ever done that thing where you just lay in bed and read a book, and you noticed it's getting brighter outside, you're not really tired but you put the book away to try and sleep anyways?
08:17:01 <Runbunny> So you get like 4 hours of sleep.
08:17:05 <Runbunny> Hai Henrik.
08:17:07 <Dot`> runbun <3
08:17:12 <Dot`> was it a good book then
08:18:30 <Runbunny> It's alright, the main character is narrating a story about himself. So he appears to be very good at anything he touches. Other than that I find it very interesting.

12:28:00 <Zounds> even if you just played it sorta as a single player game and did the story
12:28:10 <Zounds> like runbun does
12:29:31 <Zounds> and I suppose everybody does when they're just going through the game at first :P

14:14:29 <Zounds> Runbunny: what job you playing atm in ffxiv
14:19:16 <Runbunny> Machinist still. It's easier to just lvl one thing.
14:19:35 <Zounds> It is indeed
14:19:58 <Zounds> I think I'm gonna main DRK in shadowbringers
14:20:15 <Zounds> It just seems appropriate
14:21:11 <Zounds> I sorta do already but tbh I swap between it and WAR every few hours just depending on my feels at that particular moment
14:22:35 <Zounds> Or if I'm tanking something that has more magic or physical tankbuster attacks than normal x)
14:38:17 <Runbunny> I think I have to roll Dancer, like everyone else.
