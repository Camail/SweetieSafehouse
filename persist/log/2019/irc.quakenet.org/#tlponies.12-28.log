00:22:35 <Dot|Phone> Hmm, we should also play more boats games
00:22:38 <Dot|Phone> Board
00:26:40 <reification> and i though dot was suddenly about to start playing azur lane :p
00:27:15 <Dot|Phone> Is that anime boat girls? 
00:28:27 <reification> it did just get an anime
00:29:41 <reification> .tell runbunny https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/3726429
00:29:52 <Dot|Phone> If it was like tank girl anime then I would watch. But it's probably that one where they are literal boats
00:32:00 <reification> i think that has a game iirc
00:33:22 <reification> oh is ps4/switch only
00:34:22 <reification> though you can get eng subs
00:36:32 <Dot|Phone> How's the puzzle practice going Reif? 
00:38:57 <reification> it's test solving rather than practise, but it has been fine
00:39:12 <reification> i've solved all the ones so far
00:39:35 <reification> still got a set of sudoku to review though which will be harder for me
