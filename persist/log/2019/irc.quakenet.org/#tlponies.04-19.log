17:39:18 <reification> runbun when you beat everyone with one punch it shouldn't take multiple seasons
17:43:37 <Runbunny> Isekai quartet is also letting me down.
17:46:06 <Dot`> is s2 of OPM bad runbun? this is sad news
17:46:38 <Runbunny> I mean I expected the animation to be bad, since another studio took over.
17:47:05 <Runbunny> However, I didn't expect characters to drastically change behavior. 
17:47:18 <Runbunny> I'll have to read the manga to compare.
17:50:01 <reification> is there anything else this season apart from shield hero and senko runbun?
17:51:48 <Runbunny> Dororo is still continuing and is supposingly good.
17:52:57 <Runbunny> Dumbbell starts this summer so we can get in shape.
17:54:20 <Rawr|Fone> It's never too early to start getting in shape right now runbun
17:56:51 <Runbunny> True, I'm cleaning my room tomorrow, so that I once more have access to my dumbbells.
17:57:44 <reification> well i had to go to the corner store to get potatoes for dinner and ended up getting a malteser pavlova
