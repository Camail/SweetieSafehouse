16:32:50 <Kittybunny> Camail.
16:33:03 <Kittybunny> Slayer looks pretty cool.
16:33:05 <Camail> bun
16:33:11 <Kittybunny> I hope Bow slayer becomes a thing.
16:33:30 <Camail> i never thought of that
16:33:36 <Camail> the crit node is cool
16:33:55 <Camail> i'm gonna have so many endurance charges, runbun
16:34:16 <Kittybunny> Oh, as chieftain?
16:34:23 <Camail> but you can't have multistrike on your charge spender if you want to keep max charges
16:34:24 <Camail> yea
16:35:04 <Kittybunny> What skill are you going to use?
16:35:08 <Kittybunny> I forget.
16:35:10 <Camail> tectonic slam
16:35:25 <Camail> it has a 35% proc chance, same as the generation chance
16:35:45 <Kittybunny> It's like one of the only skills that you can't use multistrike with.
16:36:25 <Kittybunny> or can it?
16:36:27 <Camail> anything that consumes an endurance charge during the attack will have the same problem, right?
16:36:34 <Camail> you CAN use it
16:36:44 <Camail> but it isn't efficient for this build
16:37:04 <Kittybunny> oh lel
16:37:17 <Kittybunny> since it's a proc I guess.
16:37:31 <Camail> cuz it will consume all your endurance charges, and chieftain  gains a ton from having max charges
16:37:33 <Kittybunny> I was thinking of earthquake then I guess.
16:41:51 <Camail> yea, the new double dipping per endurance charge makes me want to keep the charges

18:33:54 <skram> where did you go pal
18:34:06 <Dot`> driving lesson
18:34:12 <Dot`> but for some reason it was ALL traffic
18:34:34 <Dot`> so hour lesson took 2 hours
18:35:14 <Camail> are you getting your license
18:35:35 <Dot`> trying
18:35:57 <Camail> it's a shame they're teaching you on the wrong side of the road
18:36:41 <Camail> driving is rough at the start, but it quickly becomes pedestrian through the sheer number of hours
18:37:22 <Dot`> most boring yet stressfull thing
18:37:32 <Camail> you kinda internalize the rules that prevent everyone from dying, and the rest don't matter
18:38:09 <Camail> the most important thing to learn is that being polite isn't always being safe
18:38:27 -!- Rawr|Fone [~AndChat52@84-217-62-32.customers.ownit.se] has joined #tlponies
18:38:32 <Camail> sometimes its your turn, and you have to take your turn
18:39:24 <skram> mhm, if you have the right of way you need to take it because thats what your enemies expect
18:39:25 <Camail> that's the only thing i had to change in my approach, i always prefer letting people do before i do, but that just leads to slow downs and confusion
18:39:37 <Camail> skram no, other drivers are not your enemies
18:40:04 <Camail> they are your allies, who are dumb and get you into trouble sometimes
18:40:41 <skram> like stupid children then
18:40:54 <Camail> yup yup
18:43:11 <Dot`> "allies, who are dumb and get you into trouble sometimes" sounds like tautology to me cam
18:44:16 <Camail> so you think all your friends are dumb wow
18:44:23 <Camail> i mean, yea i get skram, but me?
18:44:26 <Camail> hurt
18:44:35 <Dot`> its ok, i tihnk im dum too
18:44:46 <Camail> h u r t
18:45:04 <skram> im not you guys' friend
18:51:20 <Dot`> its ok skram, i will still be your friend
18:51:34 <Rawr|Fone> You don't get to decide skram
18:58:05 <skram> .tell bio https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr_ShurKYMU
19:05:08 <Camail> the fuck
19:06:06 <Camail> this isn't terrible
19:09:04 <skram> i have impeccable taste
19:09:05 <skram> you know this
19:09:30 <Camail> Kittybunny leap slam stuns full life mobs on hit, so now i don't even need a map clearing endurance charge generator
19:10:21 <Camail> but what curse do i use now? hmm
19:10:52 <Kittybunny> Warlords?
19:11:08 <Kittybunny> for even more endurance charges.
19:11:37 <Camail> but my endurance charges sustain
19:11:55 <Kittybunny> you need to spent them for more damage!
19:11:58 <Camail> once i get to max, statistically i should stay there
19:12:06 <Camail> 35% chance to gain, 35% to spend
19:12:14 <Camail> unless i put multistrike on
19:13:09 <Kittybunny> Do it for more damage.
19:13:26 <Kittybunny> Then you jump to a pack and get like 100 endurance charges.
19:16:12 <Camail> multistrike vs faster attack isn't a big sheet dps boost
19:16:17 <Camail> just going off pob
19:17:04 <Camail> poachers mark lowers evasion, does that mean my hit chance goes up?
19:19:41 <Camail> cool, reddit is telling me that's the case

19:20:11 <Camail> so i think i'll take poachers mark for the frenzy and hit chance
19:24:15 <Dot`> is this your patcg day build or your build for playing with us?
19:25:29 <Camail> hmm, dunno
19:25:52 <Camail> not sure if i'll be playing day one
19:26:24 <Camail> might speed run with runbun who knows
19:34:05 <Kittybunny> We're gonna be fast.
19:34:20 <skram> gotta go fsat
19:34:40 <Kittybunny> Not that fast.
20:16:24 <skram> Dot` when are you finished with your license

21:23:13 <Dot`> Kittybunny, hobs the furthest he has been!
21:24:37 <Kittybunny> !!!
21:25:25 <Bio> i wonder if he will ever reach his dream
21:25:34 <Kittybunny> Good thing my CS game just ended
21:26:17 <Kittybunny> Sasuke split is shit though.
21:29:19 <Dot`> boss too scary runbun
21:38:21 <Kittybunny> !!!!
21:38:24 <Kittybunny> He did it!
21:38:31 <Kittybunny> Only one left!
21:38:41 <Dot`> so close
21:38:43 <Dot`> pls no sad
21:39:48 <Rawr|Fone> Sadness is guaranteed
21:40:27 <Dot`> lol game crash
21:40:34 <Dot`> rawr snela
21:40:51 <Dot`> it is in my life but maybe not in hobbs run
21:41:23 <Rawr|Fone> Cheer up my dear
21:48:14 <Dot`> well rip
21:48:18 <Kittybunny> Rip.
21:48:25 <Camail> the end game for this build might involve getting a few items that generate more endurance charges
21:48:26 <Dot`> you where right rawr, only sadness
21:48:42 <Camail> if i can somehow get on average 72.5%  charges on use i can sustain with multistrike
21:50:19 <Kittybunny> Hmm.
21:50:35 <Kittybunny> There might be a shaper or elder mod
21:50:39 <Kittybunny> but I don't know for sure.
21:52:21 <Camail> yea there is, and there are some other itmes too
21:52:29 <Camail> they're all listed on the endurance charge wiki page
21:52:58 <Camail> ideally i'll get  the chayula gem that has it too
21:53:23 <Camail> but these are all things that cost at least 1ex so it's either being lucky or end game
21:54:12 <Camail> atziri's promise is gonna be so good for my build
21:55:04 <Camail> with my charges + my passive tree ele resists i'm looking to get mostly damage rolls on jewelery, which will be a fun change of pace
21:55:18 <Camail> damage and some stats
