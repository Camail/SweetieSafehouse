09:16:59 <Runbunny> .tell Camail They made it more "game-y" I think. It's also weird that you chose if you want to be in 1 or 2 person squad, however if you chose to be 1 you still get to fighter 2 man squads.
09:21:43 <Runbunny> .tell Camail PoE leagues are like, they try something, then when the league is over, they scale it in standard or remove it all together. If there is stuff that most people don't like, it just doesn't get to stay in the game.

12:14:01 <Runbunny> When I first heard about the class, the melee part put me off. But playing around a bit it's more like "cooldown" you build up to.
12:15:18 <Runbunny> I haven't tried monk, but ninja is too embarassing to play. 
12:15:50 <Zounds> Ninja was my first class :(
12:16:09 <Zounds> and I still enjoy it on occasion
12:18:39 <Zounds> what's embarassing about it? is it the naruto run>

17:39:29 <Dot`> then there is no going back
17:47:25 <reification> read Elf san wa Yaserarenai for some different elves
17:47:41 <Camail> thats ominous
17:48:41 <Dot`> it appears to be Lewd
17:49:24 <Runbunny> Skram should watch Golden Boy.
17:49:49 <BioPone> Eww anime
17:50:48 <Runbunny> It's an experience Bio.
17:51:06 <Runbunny> Only rivaled by taiwanese cave paintings.
17:51:07 <Camail> a vast majority of these weeb games on sale are bad
17:51:16 <Dot`> im sure bio has watched all the anime
17:51:23 <Dot`> ironicly
17:51:43 <Runbunny> Ofc. He wouldn't just base his disgust on nothing.
17:54:08 <reification> more fat that ominious cam
17:54:54 <reification> for ominous elves read arts of dark and light
18:03:13 <skram> Runbunny no
18:04:03 <Runbunny> You have to watch it at some point.
18:04:17 <Runbunny> and then tell Dub how he is wrong as well.
18:04:35 <Runbunny> Reif should get on it as well.

19:42:24 <skram> im on to you, buddy
19:42:32 <Dot`> you should watch elfen lied skram, its very happy
19:42:38 <skram> nah
19:42:42 <skram> has the word elf in the title
19:42:57 <DuB`> I don't think there's a dwarfen lied
19:43:00 <reification> it does have the best op
19:43:10 <skram> what a shame
19:44:08 <reification> it's not the same if your aren't watching the original subs by some finnish warez group
19:44:22 <skram> oh i only watch german dubs
19:44:26 <Runbunny> O:
19:44:43 <Runbunny> Watch the english dub of Ghost stories.
19:44:54 <Runbunny> That dub literally saved that anime.
19:46:34 <Zounds> Only dub I ever liked was Ghost in the Shell S.A.C
19:47:05 <Zounds> Not like it's majorly high quality or anything but for some reason I heard it first and got used to it
19:47:17 <Zounds> the tachikoma voices are brilliant though
19:49:05 <Runbunny> I mean https://youtu.be/gEdzuR6ng1I?t=323
19:49:28 <Dot`> haha
19:49:54 <reification> approved dubs: lum the invader girl, bubblegum crisis tokyo 2040 and that aussie dubbed one that aired on channel 5 about 20 years ago
19:51:54 <Runbunny> Better add ghost stories to that list Reif.
19:54:07 <reification> that is great but too much of a rewrite
19:54:39 <reification> at least lum the invader girl is true to the spirit of the orginal
19:57:10 <Runbunny> That original anime is so bad, so they kinda abridged it. 
19:57:33 <Runbunny> and it's better for it.

21:30:48 <Dot`> Nej
21:42:26 <Zounds> we have a word for moving house here skram
21:42:29 <Zounds> we call it flittin
21:42:55 <Zounds> there's your random scots info tidbit of the day
21:45:51 <Runbunny> It's flytte in danish, but that literally just means "to move". Not to confused with "bevæge" which also means move.
21:53:29 <Rawr|Fone> It's flytta in swedish

22:03:00 <Zounds> yeh I remember talking to my swedish buddy about that we do have some similar words
22:03:06 <Zounds> we call kids bairns for example
22:05:00 <Dot`> i call them youths
22:05:03 <Dot`> in a scathing voice
22:05:35 <reification> that just makes you sound old
22:05:55 <Dot`> ancient
22:06:26 <Crisium> you call kids a barn?
22:06:32 <Crisium> racist barn?
22:06:51 <Micen> racist barn.
22:06:57 <Runbunny> børn in plural.
22:07:27 <Zounds> i get that reference Micen 
22:07:40 <Zounds> and cris
22:08:12 <Dot`> i saw pony had reached over 200 ep???
22:08:25 <Dot`> ep 100 feels a lot closer than ep 1
22:08:34 <Dot`> did from then
22:08:55 <Crisium> i still need to watch the new eps this season
