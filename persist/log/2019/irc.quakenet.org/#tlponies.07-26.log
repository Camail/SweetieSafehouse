07:32:57 <DoT`> Hey CR
07:37:10 <Runbunny> Hai.
07:41:21 <DoT`> runbunny https://imgur.com/gallery/Ebgy90j
07:41:32 <DoT`> is this all lies
07:41:49 <DoT`> CockRoach, just got the tell, nice snek
07:45:14 <Runbunny> Hmm.
07:46:01 <Runbunny> The worst thing about science news is that they never link to the relevant article, that explains everything.
07:46:34 <DoT`> https://www.livescience.com/66018-permanently-magnetic-liquids.html
07:46:43 <DoT`> heres the original article the imgur one was taken from
07:48:03 <Runbunny> I meant the scienctific article. It's probably refered to as the paper in english.
07:48:36 <Runbunny> If it's still under peer review then just write that :/
07:48:36 <DoT`> yea, there where a few links in that livescience article, but i dont really know what im looking for
07:52:06 <Rawr|Phone> Good morning horses
07:54:18 <Runbunny> DoT`, https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6450/264
07:54:24 <Runbunny> It's behind a pay wall.
07:54:33 <DoT`> thats rude runbun
07:54:37 <Runbunny> but the abstract is there.
07:54:40 <DoT`> Rawr hest <3
07:54:44 <Runbunny> Henrik.
07:54:53 <Rawr|Phone> Dot hest ‚ù§
07:54:57 <Rawr|Phone> Anders.
07:55:33 <Runbunny> So from what I have gathered, the remarkable thing is that they are able to make droplets that have a certain shape and stay magnetic.
07:58:16 <Runbunny> I am not sure of the significance.

22:47:17 <DoT`> Dub your an intelligent lad, its not rocket surgery
22:48:02 <CockRoach|42> doggos!
22:48:08 <DuB`> I tried pulling things apart and couldn't even figure out how to get wire disconnected :(
22:51:18 <DoT`> every wire connector either has a clip on it or it just comes straight out
22:51:29 <DoT`> hold down clip and pull

22:56:13 <DuB`> WIRES REGARDLESS my case has a big metal cable shroud thing that doesn't seem to have any screws to remove it and I dunno if >10" gpu would fit anyway
22:58:35 <DuB`> I thought there were screws but upon closer inspection the heads just had smooth round holes in the top
23:00:42 <DuB`> Anyway time to go try pizza from a new place
