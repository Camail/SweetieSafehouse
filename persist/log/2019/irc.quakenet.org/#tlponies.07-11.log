12:08:56 <Golly> its too late dot
12:09:39 <Golly> unless you have any chocolate
12:10:52 <Dot`> i have cake left over still
12:11:05 <Golly> hmm, what kind
12:15:02 <Dot`> vanilla marble and choclate
12:17:40 <Golly> ill allow it
12:20:21 <Dot`> available for collection in australia
12:21:25 <Golly> norway has this horrible trend where every event with cake is almost always bløtkake https://nottero-bakeri.no/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/50teleg.jpeg
12:21:30 <Golly> and i dont like it much
12:22:27 <skram> please thats a marsipankake
12:22:46 <skram> and also its delicious every time what the h e c k, golly?
12:24:08 <Golly> its too much marzipan, works better for me in chocolate in smaller amounts
12:24:14 <Golly> that much at once is gross
12:24:33 <skram> :(
12:25:30 <skram> somehow i feel offended
12:26:06 <Golly> i knew this kid who would buy those sausage packs of it and chow down
12:26:22 <Golly> he was special
12:27:05 <Golly> kransekake isnt great either
12:27:12 <skram> golly do you like ANYTHING??
12:27:16 <Golly> ok blasphemysession over
12:27:19 <skram> hahah
12:28:07 <skram> i make a ton of marzipan confections at christmas every year
12:28:16 <skram> its my favorite time of year i think
12:30:01 <Golly> damn i thought of something else
12:30:09 <Golly> norwegian style donuts
12:30:11 <Golly> kinda suck
12:31:38 <Golly> https://www.jernia.no/content/uploads/smultring-oppskrift-tradisjonelle-smultringer-1600x1200.jpg
12:31:40 <Golly> i mean
12:31:43 <Golly> look at it
12:33:21 <skram> They're really good when they're fresh
12:33:46 <skram> but after they're cold they are not that good
12:33:57 <Golly> yea
12:37:07 <Golly> i did get some carrot cake at work today so, pretty pleased with that
12:37:52 <skram> carrot cake is pretty nice
12:38:26 <skram> whenever we have cake at work im usually on the night shift so I never get to have any
12:38:30 <skram> i think its a conspiracy
12:38:34 <Dot`> D:
12:38:45 <Dot`> the nice lunch lady doesnt save you ny?
12:38:52 <Dot`> any
12:39:10 <skram> if theres any left, then sometimes
12:39:19 <skram> but she gets me garlic bread when i work weekends
12:50:22 <reification> some you win some you lose
12:51:22 <reification> can't say i like marzipan but those doughnuts look tasty
12:54:12 <Golly> problem with that is you dont get the fresh one because some old lady made them and brought them to a thing thats hours later
12:54:27 <Golly> so its dry and cold
12:54:35 <skram> thats why you go to the old ladys house!
