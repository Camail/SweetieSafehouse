11:09:42 <DoT|Phone1> all the time
11:09:54 <Rawr|Fone> You are too picky with temperatures dot
11:10:07 <skram> oslo is not so bad, hamar is much colder usually
11:11:49 <Runbunny> Cold is better.
11:15:29 <skram> you were right runbun, this is hilarious
11:16:00 <DoT|Phone1> hmm. it's only about ¬£100 fir a return trip from Manchester to Oslo

11:19:05 <DoT|Phone1> Skram, how long could you support a south African in your house?
11:19:39 <skram> how much do south africans eat
11:20:22 <DoT|Phone1> I bought enough meals to last me 2 weeks of suppers, after 3 weeks I still had half of it left
11:20:40 <DoT|Phone1> so I don't think much.
11:20:49 <skram> maybe you should eat more
11:21:27 <DoT|Phone1> probably. but I'm only 5' so there isn't much to feed
11:21:56 <skram> hmm hmm
11:23:28 <DoT|Phone1> I know you have a nice couch
11:24:00 <skram> it is a nice couch
11:32:11 <Rawr|Fone> There is a nice jonas there as well dot
11:33:01 <DoT|Phone1> is that true?
11:34:03 <skram> untrue, jonases are never nice
11:34:03 <Rawr|Fone> I would say it is the very best jonas of them all
11:34:47 <DoT|Phone1> those statements could both be true
11:38:00 <Rawr|Fone> Yes
11:39:42 <DoT|Phone1> I should just show up at his door. nothing he could do then.
11:41:23 <skram> true that
11:41:34 <skram> im pretty boring though, you should bring a lego and we'll have a competition
11:42:30 <DoT|Phone1> it's fine. I'm easily entertained
11:45:46 <DoT|Phone1> I have 5 days of holiday about to use and I know Skram is off every third week.
11:45:48 <DoT|Phone1> easy
11:46:07 <skram> every 6th week
11:46:17 <DoT|Phone1> I was close
11:47:04 <Rawr|Fone> Very close
11:49:37 <DoT|Phone1> who wouldn't want their 1 week off relaxation used up by someone else?
12:04:08 <Rawr|Fone> That depends on who that someone else is dot
12:04:55 <skram> i hear africans are very rowdy

16:59:48 <Zounds> Reminded me that Made in Abyss exists too
16:59:50 <Zounds> I liked that one
17:02:52 <Zounds> Also I never actually watched Kill La Kill
17:03:13 <Zounds> It was popular on this IRC but I think I was too much of a contrarian to enjoy it
17:03:30 <DoT`> it was dum, that was the draw
17:23:01 <Camail> eh, it was more than that
17:23:48 <Camail> there were a lot of references that you'd have to know to get the most out of it, tho
17:34:30 <Runbunny> I should rewatch kill al kill.

17:39:28 <DuB`> Run bun
17:53:24 <Runbunny> But I also want to rewatch Baka to test.
18:06:18 <Camail> runbun i finally did uber lab and my build feels less garbage
18:06:24 <Camail> the degen is REAL,  tho
18:06:32 <Camail> this build could never work without a life flask
18:14:01 <Camail> we should do tlp hardcore some time in the future
18:14:55 <Runbunny> I got my last trials yesterday as well.
18:15:33 <Runbunny> Sadly my last acendency points isn't too powerful.
18:19:33 <Camail> i got to t15 maps without it so i gave up and found one from someone
18:19:42 <Camail> i did it naturally for the last two leagues
18:21:24 <Runbunny> MY friend told me that it was in his map, so I went and did it, then I returned to my own map I was running went through a door and the same trial was there as well.
18:23:13 <Camail> lul
18:24:16 <Camail> i'm strongly considering altering my build, removing all the dodge % and going for armor and replacing immortal call with molten shell
18:25:25 <Camail> i dont like losing my endurance charges, but i'll go immortal call with chieftan cuz that's really strong
18:38:23 <Runbunny> I should make a cast when damage taken set up as well.
18:38:56 <Runbunny> fortitude as well.
18:53:31 <Camail> fortitude is easy now that shield charge is a thing for spellcasters
