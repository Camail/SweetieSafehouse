03:44:05 <skram> beep boop
03:56:02 <Camail> skrum, ur awake
03:56:09 <DuB`> Why, I wonder
03:56:26 <skram> well i had a sleep
04:01:41 <Camail> dub, skram; 7 days to die is a fun zombie survival game. you should see if your interested at all
04:02:08 <Camail> its a game that scales pretty seamlessly with the number of players
04:05:56 <Camail> the RPG elements reward specialization, so you can divvy up roles and each have macro and micro goals 
04:08:43 <Camail> you can invest into being a good looter/scavenger, more combat oriented, base builder, resource gatherer, crafter
04:09:25 <Camail> I'm about 18 hours in, everything is essential and quite a bit harder to do solo
04:09:53 <Camail> but fun because every 7 days there's a huge raid on your base
04:12:50 <skram> i'd play, cam
04:12:53 <skram> dot even has it
04:13:00 <Camail> orly
04:13:00 <skram> wonder if he would plej
04:13:18 <Camail> i asked him but he might've fallen asleep before mustering up an answer
04:13:26 <DuB`> zzz
04:13:36 <DuB`> I may need something until iceborne, will look
04:13:42 <Camail> i am currently doing a crime, but i honestly think pirated and legit could play together
04:13:55 <Camail> because it's indie and its alpha
04:14:28 <Camail> if more people get it i'll probably just buy it, tho
04:14:51 <Camail> i think dot would really enjoy going into the intelligence branches
04:15:28 <Camail> it's very support focussed, and lets you build automated turrets and some useful base infrastructure
04:18:07 <skram> is it only about the base defence or do you have to traverse scary zombie places and look for things
04:22:40 <Camail> both
04:22:48 <Camail> the scavengers and looters go through towns
04:23:15 <Camail> anyone can loot but there are perks you get to increase loot from containers
04:23:48 <Camail> it ranges from half burnt down houses with a little bit of loot, to full blown hotels and hospitals that are basically dungeons
04:24:34 <Camail> there are traders that give you missions consisting of 3 options, find a hidden item in a building, dig for treasure, and clear zombies from an area
04:24:46 <skram> cool
04:24:54 <Camail> you can also specialize in doing missions, putting points into increasing rewards
04:24:57 <skram> wanna try it out tomorrow?
04:25:04 <Camail> sure
04:25:28 <skram> i'd play now but my neighbours game me shit for talking at night and waking their babby up lel
04:26:01 <Camail> they're the ones who had a baby
04:27:35 <skram> right? its not like they dont make noise
04:27:42 <skram> anyway, hopefully ill be outta here soon

09:36:01 <Dot|Phone> Hey Reif
09:36:34 <Micen> np dot 
09:37:54 <reification> hi dotties
09:41:12 <reification> oh runbunny already .told me the thing i was going to .tell him :D
09:43:36 <Micen> blah. Someone tell me to be lazy and watch anime instead of cleaning 
09:44:06 <Micen> please.
09:44:19 <reification> watch haibane renmei micen
09:44:55 <reification> or make runbunny happy and watch golden boy
09:46:25 <Micen> im like half way through my current sports anime i need to finish before i start anything else. 
09:47:51 <Micen> but i have both now on the to watch list. 
09:48:43 <reification> which sports anime would that be?
09:48:52 <Micen> haikyu!!
09:49:25 <Micen> its a good pallet cleanser after having watched March Comes in Like a Lion.  
09:50:04 <Micen> im a sucker for any goofy inspirational sports drama. Live action or anime. 
09:51:54 <reification> i don't really watch sports anime unless they cross with another genre like one outs or cross game
09:53:25 <Micen> they good imo. But i feel Kuroko no Basuke was a better telling of this anime's story .  
09:53:29 <Micen> like beat for beat. 
10:38:03 <Dot|Phone> Pon Pon

19:29:21 <Dot`> i think its my PSU, which sucks becuase its the newest part
19:29:42 <Runbunny> You don't get power at all?
19:30:14 <Dot`> it fails to start up and i get disk errors 
19:30:28 <Dot`> signs of not enough power, but the PSU is large enough
19:30:44 <Dot`> no random restarts yet or BSODS
19:31:02 <Dot`> but dodgy power supplies are bad as they often take other stuff with them when they die
19:31:04 <Runbunny> But you can enter BIOS?
19:31:16 <Dot`> im in windows now
19:31:29 <Runbunny> Hmm.
19:31:36 <Dot`> it occasionaly doesnt start up recently, and a restert or 2 fixes that
19:31:52 <Dot`> today though i had to turn ot off, remove power, cycle it, then try again
19:33:23 <Runbunny> Well I am no expert.
19:33:30 <Runbunny> But it sounds like it's skrams fault.
