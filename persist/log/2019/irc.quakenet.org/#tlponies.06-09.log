17:06:53 <Dot`> i read something on that
17:07:58 <Cane> lol Kaom died in 2 seconds.
17:08:03 <Cane> Summoner is so fun vs bosses.

19:29:17 <Dot`> i recently swapped out all my gear for ones with most of the slots i need
19:30:23 <Camail> so yea you die because you are being hit by elemental damage
19:30:36 <Camail> and probably taking like 2 times the amount of damage you should be
19:31:17 <Dot`> thats true, i dont know why i forget resists in this game all the time, was always good with them in D2
19:32:06 <Camail> remembe ryou can craft resists
19:33:04 <Camail> if your armor has an open suffix you can add resists

20:42:48 <Cane> Weird.
20:43:11 <DuB`> Does the error message say anything like "Why tf do you have so many summons?"
20:43:24 <Dot`> haha
20:52:15 <Cane> It doesn't even have the decency to tell me!
20:52:29 <Cane> "Error: Attempted to render 48,930 particles"
20:52:36 <Cane> But no, it's just a generic crash to desktop.
20:58:30 <Dot`> ive gotten dced a few times this afternoon
20:58:35 <Dot`> im blaming that on you too cane

23:01:44 <Runbunny> Neversink even made his own site where he encourages people to change the filters to their liking.
23:04:30 <Camail> it was a joke, but nevermind
