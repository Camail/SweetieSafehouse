01:16:20 <skram> what the hell happened
01:16:44 <Crisium> he was posting on twitter 2 days ago
01:18:37 <Cane> He streamed on Friday.
01:19:49 -!- Cane changed the topic of #tlponies to: RIP Geoff "iNcontroL" Robinson. https://tl.net/forum/starcraft-2/549918-geoff-incontrol-robinson-has-passed-away

01:26:55 <Golly> what the wha
01:27:42 <Camail> i'm fuckin reeling, this is by far the least expected passing i've ever seen
01:27:57 <Camail> the dude was a powerlifter!
01:28:08 <Cane> I'm in genuine shock, yeah.

01:28:30 <Cane> Dude streamed on Friday.
01:28:32 <skram> yeah seriously
01:28:49 <motbob> rip geoff
01:29:21 <motbob> i want to post my favorite clips of him, but they're about horse phalluses and such
01:29:28 <motbob> seems less than appropriate
01:29:34 <Camail> and the soulless eyes of the horse
01:29:52 <Bio> humor can help heal
01:29:53 <Camail> but i can't stop thinking about how funny he was, that's what makes it weird
01:30:06 <Cane> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JG9NMWFaNxM
01:30:21 <Camail> such a dense center of charisma and wit
01:30:59 <motbob> he was so fucking funny
01:31:20 <motbob> you can tell he must have been unimaginably funny given how mean he was to everyone :P
01:31:27 <motbob> he got a pass
01:31:41 <Zounds> yep
01:32:14 <motbob> https://tl.net/forum/general/71530-incontrol-appreciation-thread?page=2
01:32:17 <Camail> yea he was vicious, he did everything in extremes, at least publicly
01:32:57 <motbob> EACH TIME WE (zerg) HAVE TO BUILD WE TELL ONE OF OUR SACRED MINERS "HEY FUCK YOU TIME TO DIE" AND THEY DO. THEN WE GET A FUCKING BUILDING. WHICH, HALF THE TIME ISNT ENOUGH: WE HAVE TO PAY MOREE FUCKING MONEY TO GET IT TO DO SOME SHIT LIKE DICK THE GROUND OR SPRAY PISS IN THE AIR.
01:33:21 <Cane> Oh my god please link the TL post of him talking in all caps about vulture mines.

01:41:21 <Cane> HomeStoryCup was some of the best stuff to come out of the scene. Sigh.
01:41:47 <Zounds> god I used to love this stuff
01:45:18 <Camail> god
01:45:23 <Camail> he worked so hard for so long
01:45:34 <Camail> and scraped for every ounce of his success
01:45:34 <DuB`> Is that soe interviewing MC in that? huhhh
01:45:42 <Cane> Damn, that's MC yeah.
01:45:52 <Camail> it's bullshit
01:46:31 <Camail> he didn't get to reap any rewards, he didn't get to have the last half of his life
01:51:29 <Cane> I'm dying laughing from the ASUS ROG highlights video.
01:51:33 <Cane> Goddamn he was great.
01:58:36 <Cane> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ez3_xbWrvto
02:41:19 <Cane> motbob, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iSb5-X_2do you were looking for clips that weren't inappropriate, I'd start here with "girls really want to be ridden into the ground" and work your way up.
02:42:27 <Camail> i'd believe he has those bookmarked
02:42:50 <Cane> Guarantee it.
02:44:35 <motbob> the funniest thing in retrospect is kennegit taking the psychology stuff about wanting the D completely seriously
02:44:50 <motbob> that's extremely him
02:45:06 <Cane> Hahahah
