01:57:45 <Camail> skram ur a butt
01:57:55 <Camail> you still need to tell me which trials you are missing
01:58:00 <Camail> so then we can do uber lab
02:03:38 <skram> all but two i think
02:06:28 <Camail> i think you're down to one
02:06:46 <Camail> but again, that's not really the information i need if i am gonna help you
02:07:31 <skram> ok so to do uber elder you need to do all 6(?) trials that show up on maps, right?
02:07:53 <skram> uber lab
02:07:54 <skram> i mean
02:07:57 <Camail> yup
02:08:04 <skram> right
02:08:19 <Camail> and you can see which ones you've done at the lab pedestal before entering
02:08:52 <Camail> and i run a ton of glacier, so if i happen to find the trial you need, i can ping you
02:09:03 <Camail> we dont need to do the lab right then and there, but the trial is easy enough
02:09:28 <skram> how does that work actually
02:09:43 <skram> if you find a map with things on it, how do you save that map
02:10:04 <skram> can you just pull it out of the map device somehow?

02:12:12 <Camail> you dont save the map, you just wait for the person
02:12:25 <Camail> so if you're asleep then oh well
02:12:31 <skram> oh i see
02:12:39 <skram> i do like sleeping
02:12:45 <Camail> so while i have the map up, 5 other people can do the trial
02:12:56 <Camail> thats how trial sharing works on global 820

19:33:12 <Runbunny> well too late.
19:46:09 <Camail> Runbunny  someone bought so many chayula's pure breachstone you can no long scroll passed all their listings on the official tradesite
19:46:27 <Camail> thank god that ignoring them removes the listings
19:49:25 <Runbunny> I have never used the official trade site.
19:49:31 <Runbunny> I just use poe.trade
19:50:05 <Camail> the official one is better in most respects, tbh
19:50:16 <Runbunny> It's the same API anyways.
19:50:20 <Camail> no ambiguous affixes, can search for specific veiled mods
19:50:26 <Camail> the implementation is way better
19:50:37 <Runbunny> I guess I am just used to the other one.
19:50:48 <Camail> yea, i still use it most of the time
19:50:52 <Camail> but there are things it literally cant do
19:51:00 <Camail> like search for vorici veiled weapons
19:51:25 <Camail> errr
19:51:32 <Camail> not vorici, the hits cant be evaded guy
