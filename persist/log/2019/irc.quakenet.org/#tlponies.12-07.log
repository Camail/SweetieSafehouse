00:00:16 <Dot`> R is rawr
00:00:19 <Dot`> rare
00:00:34 <Dot`> it seems i just type rawr is a word starts with r
00:00:37 <Dot`> if
00:01:07 <DuB`> I would like a Shield of Rawr|Fone
00:03:59 <Dot`> i google flametounge skram and opened the top result
00:04:00 <Dot`> You can use a bonus action to speak this magic sword's command word, causing flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the sword is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword.
00:04:16 <DuB`> well then
00:04:22 <Dot`> and then i copy pasted it and was sassy
00:04:39 <skram> i also know how to use google, dot
00:04:48 <skram> i just didnt know what r meant
00:05:16 <Dot`> i had to make sure i didnt add too many rare items to the list
00:07:18 <DuB`> Protection, Aura of Protection, and Warding
00:07:22 <DuB`> I will be your shield!
00:07:28 <DuB`> Aura of Warding*
00:07:40 <skram> whats your character dub
00:08:07 <Dot`> dub i can give you a +1 shield that give adv on perception
00:08:15 <DuB`> Half-Orc paladin 
00:08:20 <skram> oh yeah
00:08:23 <skram> neat
00:08:30 <skram> wait you were supposed to be a DWARF
00:08:33 <Dot`> adv on init is just too strong for your "weak magic item" that im giving each person 1 of
00:08:35 <skram> greatest anime betrayal
00:08:44 <DuB`> Ya oke
00:09:48 <Dot`> i think every person so far has asked for a AC item
00:11:12 <DuB`> I set out to make a tank from the start! :P
00:11:36 <Dot`> so have most ppl in some fashion, haha
00:11:44 <DuB`> We gon be tough
00:11:46 <Dot`> i tihnk i broke the team
00:11:50 <DuB`> rofl
00:12:32 <DuB`> Next plan for Waterdeep is to just run the inn until we can all afford plate and shields
00:12:42 <DuB`> The outside is scary
00:12:58 <Dot`> skram, you still havnt requested a common/uncomman magic item
00:13:26 <Dot`> but dub, of you get 500000 dragons you can get all the plates you want
00:13:36 <DuB`> Hmm
00:13:54 <DuB`> skram wants a philter of love
00:14:01 <Dot`> done
00:14:24 <DuB`> Also holy moly animated shield sounds fun
00:14:32 <DuB`> Free to use big 2h weapon
00:14:52 <Dot`> so many cool magic items
00:15:55 <DuB`> Think I'm done, dot
00:16:21 <DuB`> Well, unless I should write stuff
00:16:30 <DuB`> Dunno how much backstory etc we want for 1shot
00:16:42 <Dot`> its up to you
00:16:53 <Dot`> im not going to require it
00:18:55 <Dot`> did you take any feats?
00:19:03 <DuB`> Heavy armor master
00:19:11 <Dot`> ah, there it is
00:19:44 <DuB`> Wait I'm confused about the list in discord now. Is that the total magic items list for the party?
00:20:09 <Dot`> thats the groups magic items to split
00:20:28 <Dot`> and then you each get a request for 1 uncommon for yourself
00:20:32 <DuB`> O, goodness
00:20:34 <DuB`> Haha
00:20:58 <Dot`> oh... your lvl 8
00:21:16 <Dot`> i for some reason took lvl 10 as your magic item level
00:21:19 <Dot`> well, there you go
00:21:40 <Dot`> i compared what you kind of are expected to have at lvl 10
00:24:09 <DuB`> What does "in the meantime, the Javelin can still be used as a Magic Weapon" mean? 
00:24:25 <DuB`> Just normal stats but magical weapon status/property?
00:25:20 <Dot`> for ignoring resistances and such
00:25:25 <DuB`> ya ok
00:27:32 <DuB`> Tentacle rod is wild >_>
00:27:46 <DuB`> 3d8 per turn and the debuff chance
00:30:14 <Dot`> d6 a tentacle isnt it?
00:30:25 <Dot`> and each has to hit
00:30:35 <DuB`> Ye
00:30:44 <DuB`> O d6 yeah
00:31:01 <Dot`> its nice, but seems silly and not op
00:31:18 <Dot`> i just saw it and thought "skram will lovve the hentai stick"
00:31:24 <DuB`> lolol
00:40:11 <skram> fuckin' pervert
00:42:36 <skram> is there a table of uncommon items we can do
00:46:11 <Dot`> https://donjon.bin.sh/5e/magic_items/
00:46:22 <Dot`> have a look there and request
00:46:51 <DuB`> I wrote a lil thing
00:46:58 <DuB`> Mostly for my own satisfaction :P
00:47:19 <skram> adamantine armor makes me immune to crits
00:47:26 <skram> sounds like the sort of thing i'd want against dotrolls
00:48:05 <Dot`> make another request
00:48:16 <Dot`> crits is the only joy i have
00:49:41 <Dot`> though if there is something you want that doesnt exist we can discuss too
00:50:24 <DuB`> Can I wield... TWO +1 shields?
00:50:48 <DuB`> And just punch people with them
00:53:09 <skram> could do mithral half plate
00:53:18 <skram> 17 AC and no disadvantage on stealth checks
00:55:22 <DuB`> Winged boots!
00:55:39 <DuB`> Flying is pretty great
00:56:12 <skram> meh flying is overrated
00:56:59 <Dot`> sure skram, mithril half plate
00:57:15 <Dot`> and that 4/5 ppl takem AC items
00:57:23 <Dot`> taken
00:57:48 <DuB`> So... incoming traps and spells for dc save extravaganza!
00:58:13 <Dot`> your going into a mages tower
00:58:48 <skram> mages have swords, right?
00:58:59 <skram> warlocks dual wield daggers, im told
01:03:39 <Runbunny> Skram...
01:03:47 <Runbunny> Dual wield large worcks.
01:03:50 <Runbunny> rocks*
01:04:36 <Dot`> why not dual weild hentai sticks skram
01:04:41 <Dot`> thats like 6 tentacles
01:04:42 <DuB`> :D
01:07:25 <skram> dont project your weird fetishes on me mr dot
01:21:58 <DuB`> So sleepy T_T
01:22:01 <DuB`> 9pm bedtime?

23:36:51 <Runbunny> .tell Camail I did the hunter rank 100 quest. Carted once to Teostra supernova, I let a charge attack fly, when I should have rolled and sheathed instead. Other than that there wasn't really any trouble.
23:48:28 <skram> good job, anders
23:49:49 <Runbunny> Thanks Jonas, You should do that quest as well.
