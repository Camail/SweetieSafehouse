11:11:02 <Runbunny> Good Henrik. Thank you.
11:11:31 <Rawr|Phone> Wonderful jonas
11:11:36 <Rawr|Phone> I'm doing great
11:11:44 <Rawr|Phone> No problem anders
11:12:47 <skram> how's your head runbun
11:13:18 <Runbunny> My head is fine.
11:13:48 <Runbunny> I didn't get too drunk and sobered up quite a bit when my friend broke his hard.
11:13:56 <Runbunny> arm*
11:14:01 <skram> uh oh
11:14:02 <Runbunny> his arm hard-
11:14:05 <skram> how did that happen
11:14:12 <Runbunny> Arm wrestling.
11:14:26 <skram> yikes dude
11:14:29 <Runbunny> Yep.
11:15:02 <Runbunny> So we went to a hospital, which promptly send us away since they had closed 21 minutes ago. 
11:15:33 <Runbunny> So we went on to another hospital where my friend firmly requested that I left.
11:15:49 <skram> lol
11:16:25 <skram> he just didnt want you to see him cry i guess
11:17:03 <Runbunny> Something like that I guess. Needless to say I left. 
11:17:51 <Runbunny> We didn't know the arm was broken at the time. But my friend told me that one touch from the doctor was enough to confirm it as broken.
11:18:51 <Runbunny> I have the bone snap sound stuck in my head though.
11:21:28 <skram> like a dry twig, anders
11:21:29 <skram> lovely
11:22:44 <DoT`> wait wait
11:22:55 <DoT`> the hospital sent you away becuase they had closed for the day?
11:23:00 <Runbunny> Yeah
11:23:09 <DoT`> hospitals dont close
11:23:14 <DoT`> wtf
11:23:19 <Runbunny> The trauma centers do.
11:23:35 <DoT`> "please keep your trauma withing working hours"
11:23:44 <skram> very reasonable
11:23:57 <Runbunny> No no, they just send you to the one bigger hospital.
11:24:31 <Runbunny> Except for the biggest hospital in the capital, they don't let you in the trauma center for any reason.
11:24:48 <skram> not all hospitals have emergency rooms and they close the clinics and stuff in the evening
11:24:53 <skram> why is that runbun
11:26:30 <Runbunny> I think it to keep it clear in case of emergencies. Like life or death situations.
11:26:41 <skram> i see

20:49:09 <DuB`> I'm still only 70% sure the gpu will fit in the case, but we'll burn that bridge when we get to it

20:54:05 <skram> RGBs are a waste of money
