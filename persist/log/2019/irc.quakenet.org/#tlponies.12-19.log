01:16:40 <Camail> skram the new atlas is so different
01:16:50 <skram> what did they do to it
01:16:57 <Camail> i tried to fight the last boss and go gimped by environmental hazards
01:17:02 <Camail> well...a lot
01:17:34 <Camail> the gist of it is that they changed it from drilling a path to the middle, to completing chunks of the map at a time
01:18:00 <skram> cool
01:18:07 <skram> what are your thoughts about it
01:18:13 <skram> better? worse?
01:20:52 <Camail> well, i like the old one a lot
01:21:04 <Camail> the new one has fun stuff
01:21:10 <Camail> but i really really liked the old end game
01:21:18 <Camail> and i just got to the point of farming it!
01:21:48 <Camail> this new stuff is the most unfriendly to new players
01:21:53 <Camail> out of all the content in the game
01:22:05 <skram> does it take more effort to complete
01:22:08 <Camail> but i think that's intentional, because its end game, its the last thing you do
01:22:11 <Camail> ohhhhh hell yea
01:22:15 <Camail> i literally cant carry you
01:22:45 <Camail> you can't rush through the story because it's based on overall map completion
01:22:53 <skram> dang
01:24:29 <skram> whats the end goal of the new map
01:24:45 <Camail> if i shared my map pool you'd still have to run at an absolute minimum  minimum of 80 maps
01:24:51 <Camail> if my math is right
01:25:02 <Camail> a new boss
01:25:07 <Camail> i'm not entirely sure because i'm still not done
01:25:20 <skram> ait
01:25:24 <Camail> but there's essentially a whole new level of difficulty
01:25:34 <Camail> like, uber map completion
01:25:39 <skram> no spike traps though?
01:25:46 <Camail> only in lab
01:25:49 <Camail> sirus has worse tho
01:25:53 <skram> ok good
01:25:54 <Camail> he has black death tornados
01:25:56 <skram> sirus?
01:26:06 <Camail> he's the big bad
01:26:09 <skram> fuckin' AoEs bro
01:26:27 <Camail> i literally died 5 times to them not knowing where i needed to go
01:26:33 <Camail> only died once to the boss
01:26:54 <Camail> andi have no idea how to get a second shot
01:27:06 <Camail> there are no map fragments anymore
01:27:12 <Camail> +
01:29:00 <skram> hmm
01:29:06 <skram> have to make a new character i guess
01:37:34 <Camail> arc mine saboteur is generally seen as pretty good
01:37:50 <Camail> minions are still good, most people use skellies for leveling
01:38:20 <Camail> zombies got nerfed quite heavily but they were so laughably good that now they're just normal good
01:38:39 <skram> hah ye
01:38:45 <skram> no more necromancer stuff i dont think
01:38:55 <skram> it was good but kinda boring honestly
01:39:40 <Camail> its only fun in hc, where you really dont want anything bad to happen ever
01:40:05 <Camail> but yea you could try slayer cyclone, or gladiator impale
01:40:33 <Camail> ed contagion trickster is still good
01:43:07 <skram> any good builds that spin?
01:45:34 <Camail> cyclone is the spinny build
01:46:19 <Camail> melee gets a biiiit rough with the multimod nerf
