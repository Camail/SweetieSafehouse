15:55:37 <Runbunny> Hai Reif.
15:56:14 <Camail> runbun pob has the skill tree but not the gems
15:56:32 <Runbunny> Yes.
15:56:37 <Runbunny> I was just making my build :D
15:56:48 <Camail> does generic attack damage double dip on conversions
15:57:00 <Runbunny> Nothing double dips.
15:57:04 <Runbunny> At least not anymore.
15:57:32 <Camail> ah, yea i was trying to find recent threads but it's hard
15:58:11 <Camail> converted damage is affect by all the types of increased damage, but generics only apply once?
15:58:17 <Camail> makes sense
15:58:20 <Runbunny> It used to, You just get a shaper weapon, which granted you non chaos damage as extra chaos damage. That would give extra chaos damage for each conversion.
15:59:45 <Camail> also, +1 minimum endurance charges runbun
15:59:49 <Camail> that's dank as fuck, runbun
15:59:58 <Runbunny> Minimum?
16:00:00 <Camail> yes
16:00:05 <Camail> bottom of the tree
16:00:26 <Camail> i'm tempted to make a vigilant strike build

16:03:46 <Runbunny> Apparently betrayal league had items that gave + 1 minimun charges as well.
16:06:05 <Camail> well that node let me use multistrike, which i am happy about
16:08:39 <Runbunny> You probably have plenty of endurance charge generation anyway.

20:52:54 <Dot`> bounce bounce
20:53:09 <Dot`> 350 kg rods hopping about
20:54:02 <skraaam> This is from that other movie about it
20:54:27 <Dot`> no, its in the series as a flashback at some point
20:54:46 <Dot`> i dont tihnk the footage was taken from elsewhere?
20:54:54 <skraaam> im 9000% certain ive seen this before
21:00:41 <Camail> did you dream it
21:01:03 <skraaam> i only dream about bunny girl senpai now, cam
21:01:17 <Camail> you trash
21:01:52 <skraaam> eh
21:02:04 <skraaam> you're not wrong i guess
21:04:53 <Runbunny> I opened another window.
21:05:47 <skraaam> are you naked yet
21:05:59 <Dot`> did he ever get dressed?
21:06:04 <Runbunny> Underneath my garmens.
21:06:11 <skraaam> pervert
21:11:22 <Crisium> why does skram have so many A's now
21:11:27 <Crisium> i thought he was either 1 or 0
21:12:39 <skraaam> ive leveled up
21:16:34 <Camail> we tried keeping him restrained but there's nothing we could do
21:16:51 <Camail> we could keep people logged in as the higher a's but i dont want to expose people to that
21:17:06 <Camail> and also it would just drive him further into degeneracy with a+1
21:19:16 <skraaam> you cant contain my girth
21:20:03 <Camail> the character limit can, tho
21:22:11 <Camail> i wanna do vermintide but i'm gonna have to do something at some point soon
21:22:12 <Camail> bleh
21:24:03 <Camail> Dot`  skraaam  https://www.poebuilds.cc/
21:24:11 <Camail> gotta look for builds again
21:24:50 <Camail> people are updating stuff or making new builds in the next few days
21:24:57 <Dot`> nice
21:25:12 <Dot`> think ill go witch this time
21:27:01 <BioPone> Home time
21:27:25 <Dot`> gl
21:28:30 <skraaam> im gonna be a swordbitch
21:32:29 <Camail> arc was a fun first build
21:35:38 <Camail> skram you probably want to do a cyclone build
21:35:46 <Camail> you jump into a bunch of fuckers then spin real fast
21:35:52 <skraaam> perf
21:36:15 <Camail> gotta find a slayer cyclone build
21:47:30 <Cane> Is cyclone back?
21:47:49 <Runbunny> Yes Cane.
21:47:52 <Cane> I only played in Chaos league and there wasn't as much of that.
21:48:06 <Cane> I think I heard they changed it a bit.
21:48:16 <Runbunny> It's a channeled skill now
21:48:22 <Cane> Oh thank fuck.
21:48:30 <Cane> Game is now playable.
21:48:40 <Cane> I know they initially had it the way it was because Diablo II did that.
21:48:47 <Cane> Doesn't mean it was the right thing to do lol

21:49:25 <Camail> a lot of these builds aren't updated to 3.7 yet
21:49:44 <Camail> they just changed their tag, implying they are working on conversions, i guess
21:50:44 <Cane> I wonder if Poet's Pen Volatile Dead nonsense still works, or if they said "whoops lol patched".
21:51:43 <Camail> it was nerfed in 3.6, apparently
21:52:34 <Camail> also you can use shield charge with a wand now
21:52:43 <Camail> which a lot of people are happy about
21:52:52 <Camail> no longer stuck with flame dash as your only option
22:03:13 <Cane> Ooo.
22:03:38 <Cane> I wonder if a staff build is possible. I wanted to do one but it was always, invariably, underwhelming and nobody ever made a build that used any of the game's staffs,
22:03:50 <Cane> Despite that they were expensive as fuck.
22:03:50 <Camail> staffs are split between casters and melee now
22:04:03 <Camail> so casting affixes wont roll on certain bases
22:04:37 <Cane> Hmm.
22:05:05 <Cane> I should play again. It's been a long time. I was gonna play last league but it didn't pan out and, from all accounts, it was kind of a mess.
22:05:40 <Camail> there are tons of staff nodes in the upper left quadrant 
22:05:56 <Cane> There were back in Chaos league too, but the numbers just never worked out.
22:05:58 <Camail> i imagine templar staff builds are gonna be really node efficient
22:06:00 <Cane> Item + shield was always better.
22:06:04 <Camail> true
22:06:08 <Camail> and probably still true
22:06:11 <Cane> Sadly.
22:06:16 <Camail> but it's probably viable
22:09:46 <Runbunny> I shall retire to my bed.
22:10:36 <Camail> nn
22:10:45 <Cane> Later Runbunny. <3
22:19:59 <Camail> .tell runbunny +1 minimum endurance charge isn't broken, you can't spend it infinitely like i thought. Boooo...

22:47:06 <Camail> Cane  another cool thing about cyclone is that you can move while channeling
22:47:23 <Camail> reduced movespeed, but its still more than 0
22:49:44 <Camail> but yea me, runbun, skram, dot, and tentatively dub are all playing this league
22:50:02 <Camail> so we could potentially have a 6man party doing end game league content
22:50:19 <Camail> which would be fun to see at least once
22:51:27 <Camail> armor chest pieces are gonna go up in price this league, sadly
