07:21:48 <Dot|Phone> Morning
07:25:19 <skram> mornin pal
07:36:19 <Dot|Phone> How was work skram
07:36:51 <skram> tedious
07:36:57 <skram> listened to the new TAZ arc
07:37:03 <skram> its gonna be pretty good i think
07:37:46 <Dot|Phone> How's the new system working for them
07:39:12 <skram> am watching a danish neo-nazi turned russian STALKER or something
07:39:24 <skram> they're back to DnD but Travis is the DM this time
07:40:18 <Dot|Phone> Oh, I should try watch that
07:40:33 <Dot|Phone> I should also get finish first taz
07:41:16 <skram> at this rate the comics are gonna be completed before you listen to the podcast
07:41:20 <skram> where you at in the 1st arc anyway
07:42:53 <Dot|Phone> Red robed guy had been revealed but it had been so long since I saw the start I couldn't recall who he was
07:43:06 <Dot|Phone> So i was very lost
07:43:27 <Dot|Phone> I kinda need to watch from the beginning, but that's a lot to get through
07:44:14 <skram> nah just start where you left off
07:44:43 <Dot|Phone> But I was completely lost
07:45:01 <Dot|Phone> I failed to make notes! 
07:45:06 <skram> red robe guy is the guy they were hired to look for in the first arc
07:45:15 <skram> dont remember what he's called in the actual module though

08:12:10 <Dot|Phone> Still a great part skram is in the necromancer maze thing and they have to choose if they want to push the button
08:13:21 <Dot|Phone> It's a really great character test. When building a character I think about how they would react, and more importantly why. 
08:13:31 <Dot|Phone> It's a good touchstone
08:24:43 <skram> yeah
08:24:49 <skram> wonderland was pretty rough
