19:48:35 <Rawr|Fone> Technically I am only allergic to birch trees

19:49:00 <Rawr|Fone> True
19:49:01 <DoT`> they grow on snowmens faces
19:49:23 <Rawr|Fone> But some people with birch allergies will react when earing raw vegetables and fruits

19:51:47 <Rawr|Fone> I only react if they are raw though

19:56:51 <Rawr|Fone> Did you enjoy them
19:58:03 <DoT`> yes, but also no, i was going to eat them over at least 2 days
20:04:03 <Runbunny> DoT`.
20:04:16 <Runbunny> Carrots contain a toxin.
20:04:49 <DoT`> doesnt everything?
20:05:46 <Runbunny> It does.
20:05:48 <DuBphon> I've been far too healthy since moving
20:05:51 <Runbunny> At least plants.

22:35:50 <Zounds> dab
22:38:23 <DuB`> zond
22:42:56 <DuB`> Speedfan says my "AUXTIN3" is at 95C but I dunno what it is >:T Everything else is <30C and nothing seems amiss
22:43:42 <skram> its probably safe to ignore it
22:43:59 <DuB`> Bad sensor or something?
22:44:16 <skram> non-existant maybe?
22:44:47 <DuB`> It changes a bit which is the weird thing
22:44:52 <DuB`> 93-96ish
22:45:11 <skram> well its auxilliary sensor nr 3 which could be anything or nothing at all
22:45:30 <DuB`> Makes my aux3 fan run at max rpm all the time, but as long as everything works perfect oh well I guess
22:46:41 <DuB`> New ram is in and xmp'ed, wew
22:47:35 <skram> hmm
22:47:42 <skram> my auxin0 is showing -128c
22:47:48 <DuB`> loooooool
22:48:15 <DuB`> skram over here using custom exotic cryo cooling in his pc
22:49:06 <skram> i got a tank of liquid nitrogen
22:49:15 <skram> but only in one spot because my cpu is ~60c
22:51:01 <DuB`> cozy cpu
22:52:38 <skram> hmm i dont actually know what motherboard i have

23:04:05 <DuB`> Dunno what corsair put in this aio cpu cooler but I've never seen it over 51c
23:04:07 <DuB`> v nice
23:05:08 <skram> is it one of those watercooled boys
23:05:15 <DuB`> ya
23:06:46 <skram> well water is good at carrying heat to the radiator which has a much larger surface area than a regular cpu heatsink
23:07:17 <DuB`> It's not really bigger than a big air rad though, it's just a one-fan dealio
23:07:44 <DuB`> Different kind though ye
23:10:13 <skram> Actually I had to do some work at a big heatsink at work which is honestly the same thing as that corsair cpu cooler thing only a bit bigger
23:12:24 <DuB`> :O
23:14:51 <skram> It was running at about 16MW which is roughly 1600l of light fuel oil or 3,5 tons of firewood
23:15:25 <DuB`> That's a lotta hot
23:22:06 <skram> too many hot, DuB`!
23:22:16 <DuB`> Did you try ice
23:23:03 <skram> it gets expensive quick
