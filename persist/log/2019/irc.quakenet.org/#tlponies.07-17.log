12:46:55 <skram> how's the you
12:46:58 <Micen> good morning Skram. 
12:47:25 <Micen> im okay. trying to figure out food since i cant eat a lot after tomorrow.
12:47:57 <skram> is tomorrow surgery day?
12:48:00 <Micen> yep. 
12:48:04 <Micen> and get this 
12:48:13 <Micen> I still dont know what time my surgery is/ 
12:48:48 <skram> hanging around in the hospital waiting area for hours is always a good time
12:48:53 <Micen> They scheduled the day. but cant tell me the time until later today. 
12:49:01 <Micen> i dont even know how early to show up!
12:49:28 <Micen> its a small hospital so the doc shares surgical theater with other doctors so he could be working the afternoon. 
12:49:47 <skram> i see
12:49:55 <Micen> according to them they dont schedule until the day before. 
12:50:31 <Micen> its dumb. I cant plan an optimal sleep if I dont know the time
12:50:44 <skram> dont worry
12:50:52 <skram> they'll give you chemically aided sleepy times
12:51:11 <Micen> i mean so i dont do something like eat in the middle of the night. 
12:52:10 <Micen> i know how long i sleep and that i cant eat after midnight.  i plan my sleep for things like fasting bloodwork and what not so it falls in the most amount of time and I wake up just before i have to leave.
12:52:17 <Micen> i have bad self control skram. 
12:53:03 <skram> yeah me too
12:53:15 <skram> only reason i sometimes wake up at reasonable hours is because i have to

18:58:15 <Camail> i'm a nice boy
18:58:22 <Rawr|Fone> Camail is a very wholesome person
18:58:34 <Runbunny> When did that happen?
18:58:53 <Rawr|Fone> It's always been like that
18:59:07 <Runbunny> Hmm.
18:59:40 <Runbunny> Maybe it's the 2 hour getting bodied session that soiled my view.
18:59:49 <Runbunny> multiple sessions.
19:02:30 <Camail> in which game
19:10:43 <Runbunny> All of em?
19:11:05 <Runbunny> I was mostly thinking of street fighter 4.
19:13:09 <Camail> true
19:13:30 <Camail> runbun i sold my big belt and now i'm waiting to get an inspired learning
19:13:43 <Camail> maybe i can do decent 4way runs
19:14:40 <Runbunny> Neat.
19:15:02 <Runbunny> I got hooked on Warframe again.
19:15:08 <Runbunny> So I have been doing that a lot.
19:15:59 <Camail> that's good
19:16:08 <Camail> tenno con happened recently, anything new?
19:16:28 <Runbunny> Indeed. They showed off the new railjack thing.
19:17:12 <Camail> woo
19:17:16 <Camail> have you played with dub at all
19:17:20 <Runbunny> Which is like a space ship battle thing? You team up with other people and pilot a giant space ship together.
19:17:20 <Camail> he's a big space ninja nerd
19:17:27 <Camail> oh right i heard about that
19:17:41 <Runbunny> Yeah I saw. But he haven't been on at the same time as me.
19:30:50 <Golly> i have played it a bit as well, but not in a while now
19:32:02 <Golly> its a strange patchwork of a game but one hell of a f2p
19:32:43 <Golly> they are doing a tune up of the graphics i think they revealed as well
19:36:43 <Camail> it's very much like poe that way
19:36:58 <Camail> where it clearly started off as something and has had a bunch of content patches
19:37:24 <Camail> and what hollow knight regrettably became

19:38:34 <Runbunny> It's really hard to get into though.
19:39:10 <Runbunny> There is just a whole lot of stuff.
19:40:40 <Golly> it is, though i did like how the early part of the game has a somewhat logical sense of progression
19:41:00 <Golly> late game is all fashionquest or whatever, which i dont care for that much
19:46:18 <Runbunny> I played on and off for a few years, so every time I came back something else was changed.
19:46:35 <Golly> ye√•, i came back for the venus thing
19:47:17 <Runbunny> Like, I didn't actually realise that quests were a thing until like half a year ago.
19:48:57 <Golly> haha
19:50:06 <Golly> theres like an upwards jump i didnt know about, so i though i was stuck and abandoned a level
