13:46:23 <Dot|Phone> It might get cancelled too ?

14:48:13 <Dot|Phone> He heard the call
14:48:20 <DuB`> :o
14:48:37 <Dot|Phone> Dub. Your law is being ignored by all
14:48:48 <DuB`> o
14:49:02 <Dot|Phone> Will you just allow this travesty to continue
14:49:15 <DuB`> I don't think it was ever signed into law by the President of TLP in the first place
14:50:05 <skrma> TLP isnt a republic
14:50:38 <DuB`> Well there's the problem
14:50:44 <Dot|Phone> What are we skram
14:51:08 <skrma> im not sure
14:52:01 <skrma> its a communist utopia probably
14:52:05 <skrma> chairman dot decided it
14:52:34 <DuB`> So the lack of law enforcement is DOT'S fault?
14:53:37 <Dot|Phone> Dub you are delegated the responsibility of enforcing the rightful law of order
14:54:17 <DuB`> I'll need a mechanism of realizing that enforcement power
14:54:37 <DuB`> Like a big stick
14:54:45 <Dot|Phone> Have a trout

14:56:53 <Dot|Phone> I have eaten 3 crumpets today
14:56:58 <Dot|Phone> I think that's it
14:57:33 <DuB`> I've been realizing that it doesn't actually take much food to feel fine
14:58:26 <DuB`> I have like... a piece of bread (or nothing half the time) for breakfast, and a granola bar or something at lunch
14:58:40 <DuB`> Then a decent dinner
14:59:51 <Dot|Phone> Yea, I really don't eat much, though if I'm active I may eat more
15:01:49 <DuB`> Man
15:02:11 <Dot|Phone> Dub why are you here so early
15:02:13 <DuB`> Not having any meetings or anything and being able to chill and work at home on friday is niiiice
15:02:25 <Dot|Phone> Ah
15:02:26 <DuB`> Just a couple quick things to finish up then I get to move on to FREEDOM
15:02:46 <Dot|Phone> Meetings are always so much fun though
15:03:39 <DuB`> They're fine
15:04:16 <Dot|Phone> Do you play meeting bingo? 
15:04:19 <DuB`> My team is cool and work pretty efficiently
15:04:29 <DuB`> Bingo! No :o
15:05:19 <skrma> i once had an 8 hour long meeting
15:05:23 <skrma> worst day at work
15:05:43 <Dot|Phone> You all make sheets with the spaces having words and phrases you expect to hear

15:06:15 <Dot|Phone> Was out about all the fires you start
15:06:15 <Dot|Phone> It
15:06:21 <skrma> nono
15:06:40 <skrma> the subject was HYDRAULIC CHALLENGES IN DISTRICT HEATING GRID
15:06:41 <skrma> or something
15:06:45 <skrma> we talked about pumps
15:06:53 <Dot|Phone> Exciting
15:07:14 <DuB`> Speaking of heating, I have NO IDEA what the criteria for on/off on my heater here are...
15:07:30 <skrma> dont you have thermostats?
15:07:45 <skrma> wait how is your apt heated
15:07:48 <DuB`> There's a lil valve under it that I have to open, but the heat only runs sometimes
15:08:00 <DuB`> Seems to be attached to a random number generator...
15:08:06 <Dot|Phone> By hamsters in guessing skram
15:08:09 <Dot|Phone> I'm
15:09:12 <skrma> take a picture of the lil valve boi DuB`
15:09:34 <DuB`> It's just the on/off
15:09:44 <DuB`> O ya like this https://www.brickunderground.com/blog/2015/12/radiators
15:09:45 <skrma> are you sure
15:10:07 <skrma> because the radiator valve thing usually is graduated 1-whatever and you just set it to what you like
15:10:24 <Dot|Phone> Skram is a valve man
15:10:37 <skrma> ooh
15:11:28 <skrma> i guess thats not true for steam radiators
15:11:33 <Dot|Phone> To much excitement for him
15:12:08 <skrma> i guess its just on forever, DuB`
15:12:33 <DuB`> No steam right now!
15:13:01 <Dot|Phone> Ask someone else in the building
15:13:11 <skrma> dont tinker with it though
15:13:14 <DuB`> I'mma just get a lil electric heater for more... customizable heating
15:13:18 <skrma> steam is sooper dangerous
15:13:30 <DuB`> Ya
15:14:38 <skrma> does it only have one pipe into it DuB`
15:14:45 <Dot|Phone> That's right dub, avoid all contact with other ppl ss much as possible
15:15:19 <DuB`> Think so skrma, kinda hard to see under
15:16:25 <skrma> that means the condensate travels in the same pipe as the steam
15:16:31 <skrma> multiphase flow, y'all
15:16:43 <skrma> v v v dangerous in high pressure systems
15:16:51 <DuB`> Uh huh
15:16:53 <DuB`> It's noisy :P
15:17:08 <skrma> he's trying his best, dub :(
15:17:41 <DuB`> O
15:17:45 <Dot|Phone> Dub please move, can't have it exploding on you
15:17:57 <DuB`> Well I got $100 amazon bucks from my boss
15:18:07 <DuB`> And can have a lil electric heater delivered by tomorrow
15:18:11 <DuB`> ez ez
15:18:31 <skrma> whats up with that
15:18:35 <Dot|Phone> Why is your boss bribing you
15:19:08 <DuB`> Managers and directors get a "real-time recognition" budget they can hand out to people who do good stuffs,  I guess
15:20:05 <Dot|Phone> Sounds like bribery
15:20:22 <skrma> ur a good boi, dub
15:20:41 <skrma> but if your boss is a shithead that just sounds like face tax
15:21:35 <DuB`> My bosses are pretty great
15:23:17 <skrma> good
15:23:41 <skrma> i'd be quite upset if they treated uncle skrams favorite nephew unfavorably
15:23:43 <Dot|Phone> How's the seating thing thing dub. You find a group to hang with it
15:24:29 <DuB`> I have a general area I ususally get a seat in, where I know a few people
15:25:04 <DuB`> The team I've worked on projects with so far is actually super small so I haven't done great at getting to know people
15:25:12 <DuB`> Will be getting more work with different teams here soon though
15:25:42 <Dot|Phone> This structure is very confusing
15:26:21 <DuB`> Ya
15:27:13 <Dot|Phone> You got much work to do today? 
15:27:59 <DuB`> Basically partners/directors drive business and get  clients & projects to work on, then have a pool of managers and associates to assign to the projects as needed. Could be a  2-person team or a 100-person team
15:28:13 <DuB`> No haha, hence working from home. Pretty much done now
15:29:09 <Dot|Phone> But these teams they create are unrelated to the team your part of that has your manager? 
15:30:16 <DuB`> Each project team will have a manager per certain number of associates (usually just 1)
15:30:30 <DuB`> I've been on 3 projects, all under the same manager so far
15:30:43 <DuB`> Could have 3 different managers if I'm working on more diverse projects
15:31:01 <Dot|Phone> So your current manager that gave you the gift card isn't a set manager 
15:31:07 <DuB`> Ya
15:31:43 <Dot|Phone> But so they normally pick ppl they have worked with before? 
15:31:55 <DuB`> Everyone does have an assigned manager and director assigned as their coaches in the long term though
15:32:14 <Dot|Phone> Hmm
15:32:30 <DuB`> To some degree, but they're generally good at recognizing that lots of people need chances to network and try things
15:33:06 <DuB`> And my coaches have helped me get in touch with people who may need another associate to help out, etc
15:33:53 <Dot|Phone> The corporate world skram
15:33:57 <Dot|Phone> What a place
15:34:08 <DuB`> It's a PARTNERSHIP not a CORPORATION :P
15:34:38 <Dot|Phone> .... They are the same thing to us simple ppl
15:35:17 <DuB`> Main thing is no shareholders/stock
