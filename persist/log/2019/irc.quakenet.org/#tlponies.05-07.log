07:02:01 <DuB`> Send me in your place!
07:02:05 <DuB`> Be there in 15hr
07:03:06 <DoT|Phone1> hmm. it is flexi time. but I don't think by that much
07:03:26 <DoT|Phone1> guess I'll have to do it then
07:03:47 <DuB`> :T
07:04:26 <DoT|Phone1> I'm sure I'll survive
07:04:38 <DoT|Phone1> where is Skram though
07:07:59 <DuB`> Tardy, that delinquent
07:08:29 <DoT|Phone1> tsk tsk. just like him
07:08:39 <DoT|Phone1> Probably sleeping in
07:09:32 <DoT|Phone1> you got a name for your pole arm lad yet dub?
07:12:57 <DuB`> Ya
07:13:28 <DoT|Phone1> hmm. names are hard
07:13:45 -!- Golly [Golly@cm-84.212.249.112.getinternet.no] has joined #tlponies
07:14:07 <DoT|Phone1> not only do I need one for wizard but also pseudodragon familiar
07:15:23 <DuB`> TWO names? Impossible
07:15:49 <DoT|Phone1> that's like double the names!
07:20:37 <DoT|Phone1> do you need to finish these tricky exams before you start work dub? or is it more a complete within a time of starting work
07:21:31 <DuB`> I just need to be CPA before I can move on / be promoted, etc
07:21:59 <DuB`> Over the next year, basically
07:22:02 <DoT|Phone1> ah. not too pressured for time then. that's good
07:22:42 <DoT|Phone1> and you will have time to talk to ppl who have done it too
07:23:57 <DuB`> Ya ya
07:24:16 <DuB`> I'mma start with the hardest of the 4 tests, I think
07:24:47 <DoT|Phone1> while studies are fresh. good plan
07:24:53 <DuB`> No CPA study burnout to start, and becaue you have to pass all 4 in the same 14-month (or something like that) period
07:25:03 <DuB`> So starting with one that might take 2 tries is safer
07:25:20 <DoT|Phone1> smart
07:25:34 <DoT|Phone1> is there old papers to go through?
07:25:43 <DuB`> ?
07:26:12 <DoT|Phone1> previous exam papers
07:26:29 <DuB`> Ah
07:26:54 <DuB`> I have a whole $4000 study course the firm gave access to with all sort of materials, I'm sure there's plenty like that
07:27:11 <DoT|Phone1> Oh nice
07:27:44 <DuB`> I'll basically just be following a schedule of stuff I make in that course

18:50:54 <Camail> i mained a water mage dub, no worries
18:51:00 <Camail> i can put out your flames
18:51:02 <Camail> just dont curse them

18:55:11 <skram> hai
18:55:15 <Camail> is what you were typing
18:55:19 <Camail> i finished your sentence
18:55:19 <skram> i am already divine
18:55:20 <Camail> np
18:55:28 <Camail> not THE divine
18:55:38 <DuB`> Ya
18:56:01 <DuB`> Apotheosis awaits
18:56:17 <Camail> dub wants to eat people and tell you their stories
18:56:19 <Camail> it's his thing
18:56:48 <Camail> have you learned any skills from severed feet yet
18:56:56 <Camail> that's how my sebille learned first aid
18:57:04 <DuB`> Haha
18:57:06 <DuB`> Can't remember
18:57:11 <Camail> also i went a long time without realizing first aid cures knockdown
18:57:29 <Camail> well rested is the opposite status
18:57:43 <DuB`> Put a band-aid on your "help I slipped and fell"
18:57:49 <Camail> so going into battle already rested means you get a free KO avoidance
18:58:02 <Camail> which you can do with a single bed
18:58:11 <Camail> it's VERY crowded
18:58:13 <Dot`> Dub, what was the goat violence anime you liked?
18:58:21 <DuB`> wha
18:58:24 <Camail> normal life
18:58:26 <Camail> fuck
18:58:26 <DuB`> Oh nichijou lol
18:58:34 <Camail> i couldnt remember the real name
18:58:35 <DuB`> #1
18:58:49 <Camail> it's really the best
18:59:11 <Dot`> thanks, couldnt recall the name
19:07:00 <DuB`> Woohoo rainstorm
19:24:51 <Phearlock> I despise fire in Divos, I need everything to be frozen.
19:25:01 <Phearlock> Ground, trees, enemies, allies
19:27:03 <reification> phear is mei?
19:27:16 <skram> confirmed
19:27:38 <Phearlock> well ok, the other half of the party is like, regular physical damage shit.
19:27:44 <Camail> skram you can be a dwarf barbarian in divinity 2
19:27:49 <skram> oh
19:27:51 <skram> downloading rn
19:28:22 <Camail> you can dual wield, or use A BIG DICK WEAPON
19:28:32 <Phearlock> 2hand warrior shit with some rogue and necromancy skills to round out the build is still probably my favorite.
19:28:34 <skram> how great are the swords
19:28:35 <Camail> i had a dwarf two-hander in my party and he did sooooo much damage
19:28:45 <Camail> not just swords, skram
19:28:52 <Camail> axes, maces, big ones
19:29:25 <DuB`> But all you really need is a poison wand and a fire wand to make things go kablooey-boom
19:30:07 <DuB`> Unless they're undead
19:30:15 <DuB`> In which case, of course, the solution is to simply add more fire
19:30:23 <Camail> spending ap on wand attacks? pathetic
19:30:38 <DuB`> Early on!
19:30:44 <Camail> PATHETIC
19:31:09 <Phearlock> Skram you can even have your wizard friends teleport the enemies to your barbarian so you don't have to use any action points to move to them.
19:31:18 <Camail> OR
19:31:21 <Camail> teleport your barb onto them
19:31:28 <Phearlock> This is also a superb idea
19:31:29 <Camail> dealing damage with their body
