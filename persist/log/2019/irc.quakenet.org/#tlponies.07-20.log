00:03:13 <DoT`> easy
00:04:59 <DoT`> really, non multiclass fighter or monk is probably more optimal, but eh
00:08:19 <Micen> Tunnel fighter seems broken. 
00:08:40 <DvB`> And not very lore for a birb :P
00:09:01 <Micen> are we not talking about your sea faring human?
00:09:40 <DvB`> That too
00:10:02 <Micen> it really seems like it should have some sort of clause that you can only go into a defensive stance if there are walls within your reach on two sides. 
00:10:08 <DvB`> But also the idea of that with a polearm-wielding birb who can hover 10ft up
00:10:41 <Micen> that does seem broken. 
00:11:25 <Micen> but thats when the dm gets to play with things like gunslinger and clipping shot 
00:21:41 <DoT`> micen, imagine, gunslinger monk
00:21:49 <DoT`> very equilibrium
00:22:42 <Micen> gun fu
00:42:31 <Camail> thats just bayonetta
00:42:39 <Camail> guns on your FEET
00:55:59 <DoT`> i go now
00:56:00 <DoT`> later pons

22:42:13 <DoT`> dub
22:42:19 <skram> I found out something neat today
22:42:43 <DoT`> did you find out about you skram
22:42:47 <skram> To get a mortgage on a house you need 15% of the house price as a down payment, right?
22:43:22 <skram> But apparently the union im a part of can somehow cover a portion of that via a loan presumably
22:43:42 <skram> So basically, if this works out, I should be able to buy a whole house way sooner than I'd thought
22:43:48 <DoT`> skramHouse when?
22:43:55 <DoT`> i want to visit skramHouse
22:44:04 <skram> soon i hope
22:44:18 <Rawr|Fone> That sounds great skrammypants
22:44:39 <DuB`> Wowee
22:45:34 <skram> I got ~20k saved up and normally I'd need 35-40k
22:46:12 <DoT`> gj skrammmmmen <3
22:46:17 <DuB`> So you're saying you CAN send me a 2080ti for christmas then?
22:46:35 <DuB`> Naw glgl
22:46:37 <Micen> he could send us all 2080tis then
22:47:20 <skram> Most of it is in a special high interest bank account that I cant withdraw from so I probably couldnt :P
22:47:38 <DuB`> I'll be saving for my retirement place in Lucerne in the meantime
22:47:42 <DuB`> And paying rent forever until then

23:45:32 <skram> yeh they're great but seem very difficult to roleplay
23:46:42 <DoT`> yea, ppl expect you to always say witty things when you use cutting words, but no one expects the wizard to spout magical phrases every time he casts a spell
