19:08:40 <skram> wonderful
19:09:28 <skram> what you been up to lately
19:10:17 <Phearlock> Ruining my sleep schedule mostly
19:11:01 <Phearlock> Some work. Some games (Equestria at War, smash bros, Starsector). Bit of light reading.
19:11:54 <skram> equestria at war?
19:12:08 <Phearlock> Mod for hearts of iron 4
19:12:17 <skram> ooh yeah
19:12:26 <Phearlock> Its real good xD
19:12:41 <Phearlock> Nice writing, lots of interesting countries.
19:12:48 <skram> is germaney in it
19:13:00 <Phearlock> Sorta. Changelings get the german tech.
19:13:09 <Phearlock> And the german uniforms =D
19:13:50 <skram> i guess changelings would make good panzer crews
19:15:39 <Phearlock> But ye there's lots of nice stuff to do. Can bring back sombra and play as that guy. Can play the finnish/swedish deer and motti the changelings as they push through your mountains.
19:16:02 <Phearlock> Can integrate the cute batponies as equestria, or not, and have luna get very upset about it.
19:17:01 <Phearlock> Fluttershy can give you a bonus to your nuclear research.
19:17:09 <Phearlock> Because of course they do that reference
19:18:24 <skram> wait
19:18:31 <skram> is that a FO:E reference
19:18:34 <Phearlock> yes
