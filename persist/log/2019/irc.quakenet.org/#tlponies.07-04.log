15:49:44 <Kittybunny> No clue where you get that one.
15:49:49 <Kittybunny> Is just cards?
16:10:22 <Camail> it's just a jewel drop
16:10:24 <Camail> i think
16:10:56 <Camail> usually not super expensive, but this league it's crazy strong because of the doubling up on rare monster mods

18:11:13 <DuB`> Gonna go get a BURGER todey for america
18:12:01 <DoT`> does it come with a free gun?
18:14:42 <DuB`> Not in NYC I'd bet
18:15:25 <DoT`> oh, is it a free first time investment in a pyramid scheme?
18:15:32 <DoT`> the true meaning of capaitilism
18:17:12 <DoT`> i wish i had a burger now
18:23:23 <Zounds> don't let your dreams be dreams DoT`
18:24:10 <DoT`> ive alreayd eaten though and wouldnt know where to get a burger around here
18:24:44 <Zounds> I see I see
18:24:49 <DoT`> i was thinking, and its been probably over a year since i had a burger
18:24:56 <DuB`> I have to choose from a dozen burger places
18:25:02 <DoT`> and even longer since i had one not at home
18:25:03 <DuB`> Half those within 200 meters!
18:25:57 <Kittybunny> I did it zounds.
18:26:04 <Kittybunny> I defeated Stormblood.
18:26:20 <Zounds> nice runbunny
18:26:24 <DoT`> dub, i have a canadian friend who is apparently about 4,5 or so hours north of you who has invited me to shoot guns if i ever visit
18:26:26 <DoT`> gj runbun
18:26:33 <Zounds> that shit is small fries compared to what's coming next
18:26:44 <DuB`> Very nice dot
18:26:58 <Kittybunny> Yeah now there's all the patches to beat I think. Then it's shadowbringer time.
18:27:34 <DoT`> is this normal american behavious dub? invite ppl to come shoot guns
18:27:40 <Zounds> Stormblood was great but Shadowbringers makes it look like shit
18:27:46 <DuB`> Well yes
18:28:01 <Zounds> I shot guns when I was in sweden
18:28:04 <Zounds> so we do it in europe too
18:28:09 <DuB`> When we went down into the desert to visit sister's fiancee's family that's exactly what we did
18:28:29 <DoT`> zounds, sweden is a silly place, we cant use it as a referance
18:28:38 <Zounds> shooting guns is a fun activity
18:28:44 <Zounds> and a bit harder than it looks
18:29:07 <Kittybunny> Sounds expensive.
18:30:20 <DoT`> TJ says hi btw skram
18:30:34 <Zounds> There's a lot of swedes who would cry at the sight of a gun I think
18:30:48 <Zounds> But they do have their tougher sorts too. still a bit of viking left in them
18:30:57 <DoT`> Rawr pls confirm
18:31:00 <skram> oh sweet

19:20:55 <Zounds> hey cris
19:39:44 <Camail> oh also skram lvl 21 cyclone has 7 stages instead of 6
19:39:53 <skram> ooh
19:39:54 <Camail> so thats +1 range
19:39:58 <skram> yeh
19:40:01 <skram> thats quite the upgrade
19:41:20 <Camail> and you can buy 2 foils as upgrades
19:41:51 <Camail> i'd say lvl 21 cyclone with as much quality as you can reasonably buy, and two foils around 280-300 pdps
19:41:57 <Camail> that'd be a biiiig upgrade for you
19:42:08 <Camail> and is a very attainable upgrade path
20:05:20 <skram> why do we like foils so much

20:44:28 <skram> im telling the truth i swear
20:50:02 <DoT`> see rawr
20:59:49 <Camail> skram we like foils because they have the best dps for a 1h sword
21:00:00 <Camail> and you love them because they have 14 weapon range for cylcone
21:00:29 <skram> ooh
21:00:44 <Camail> the best cyclone foils have +3 weapon range from deafening essence of dread crafts
21:00:49 <Camail> so thats 17 base weapon range
21:01:07 <Camail> + all the other bonuses, you can get full screen cyclone
21:01:26 <DuB`> Who's up for TTS terraforming mars sometime this week/end?
21:01:28 <DuB`> We shud do
21:01:37 <skram> YA

21:03:49 <DuB`> They have it at barnes and noble and I still have $70 on my gift card, perfect
21:03:55 <DoT`> i do have one, if the one on the workshop has been taken down, but it should still be there
21:03:57 <Camail> dub the TTS scrub

21:08:32 <DoT`> gl being free cam
21:08:33 <skram> camail all i have is chaos
21:09:17 <Camail> yea but how much, was the question
21:09:28 <Camail> like ballparking, how much can you spend of foils
21:09:45 <Camail> because you can get a foil anywhere from 10c to 6ex
21:09:55 <skram> 84 i think
21:10:15 <Camail> thats enough for two solid foils + a bit left over
21:10:23 <Camail> i'd say 30c a foil is good

23:26:55 <skram> ugh DuB` you got it all wrong
23:27:02 <skram> im not a cat person
23:27:09 <skram> im a dwarf with an unhealthy cat obsession
23:27:17 <DuB`> o dang
23:27:24 <DuB`> Are there dwarf catgirls
23:27:50 <skram> only in my dreams i think
23:41:41 <reification> hmm or are they just loli catgirls :O
23:41:46 <reification> night all
23:42:01 <skram> cant be a loli if you have a beard, reif
23:42:03 <skram> gnight pal
23:57:05 <Zounds> They call the race I play in FFXIV "dwarves" now in the new land you travel to
23:57:11 <Zounds> I don't buy it at all
23:57:34 <Zounds> The "dwarves" native there do wear beards though at least but they craft them rather than grow them
23:59:04 <skram> that sounds like some elf mumbojumbo zounds
23:59:07 <skram> dont like it
23:59:30 <Zounds> They do the same shit with the elezen they're called "Elves"
23:59:38 <Zounds> however they look the part way more already so that's fine
23:59:53 <Zounds> they pretty much are elves
