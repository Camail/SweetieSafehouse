17:42:30 <Zounds> hey
17:42:38 <Camail> pls
17:45:01 <Camail> hey dot would you like to try out 7days?
17:45:14 <Camail> we could do a new map, start fresh just to figure out how you like the game
17:48:47 <Dot`> next week is probably better, going to bakewell this weekend so wont be able to play
17:49:17 <Camail> i meant like, right now. but ok
17:49:21 <Dot`> i played it years ago, a friend really bugged me to play it, it was very basic back then, sounds like its far better now
17:49:44 <Dot`> well if you started again i would then not be around, so keep going with your current one
17:50:02 <Dot`> then i can join once you do that start over
17:50:31 <Camail> i wasn't planning on scrapping the current map
17:50:41 <Camail> i just dont want to start you on a map where we already have stuff
17:51:04 <Camail> so learning to play on a different map, figuring out what you like, then making a new character
17:51:24 <Camail> respeccing is VERY expensive so having a first character to make mistakes on is a good idea
17:52:13 <Camail> ah, i thought you owned it because you were interested in it
17:52:22 <Camail> nbd then play f you want to

22:57:36 <Zounds> he was an earth pony like me
22:57:44 <Zounds> and that makes him cool
22:58:07 <skram> i was earth poni too because i was real into digging holes for 15 hours a day
22:58:27 <Zounds> oh yeah
22:58:31 <Micen_> but of all ponies earth ponies are the lamest. 
22:58:31 <Zounds> you're cool too skram

22:58:46 <Zounds> Poor micen
22:58:48 <Camail> i wont like, the current base i am building and the Long Hole both come from the same inner part of me that created The Hole
22:58:50 <Camail> lie*
22:58:52 <Zounds> pleb filtered
22:59:01 <skram> haha
22:59:30 <Camail> earth ponies got xp from mining before it was implemented into real minecraft
22:59:37 <Camail> making us the most canon
23:00:03 <skram> my 7 year old nephew was real into minecraft a bit ago and he got all weird when i told him i was real into it when I was a kid too
23:00:03 <Zounds> we also travelled really fast in 1x2 spaces by holding our super jump feathers
23:00:16 <Camail> yes
23:00:18 <Zounds> and our 2nd inventory was da bomb
23:00:22 <skram> hell yeh
23:00:26 <Camail> it DESTROYED the food meter tho
23:00:31 <Camail> like, i could watch it go down
23:00:50 <Zounds> Good thing I grew infinite apples with my earth pony powers
23:00:57 <skram> didnt earth horses also have some sorta bonus to apples
23:01:04 <Zounds> we could grow them
23:01:08 <Zounds> only ones that could
23:01:10 <Camail> i never did the apple things
23:01:14 <skram> right right
23:01:24 <Camail> i spent most of my time building community stuff
23:01:42 <Camail> what a weird time
23:01:47 <Micen_>  blah i only got 4 tempered elder dragon investigations from following Kirin for a half hour. 
23:01:48 <Camail> there was a guy who thought i hated him
23:01:52 <Camail> because ya know, i'm me
23:01:59 <skram> im shit a building so i built most of my stuff underground
23:02:25 <Zounds> Did you guys ever visit my chillaxation chamber
23:02:31 <Zounds> the underwater one
23:02:45 <Zounds> it was comfy
23:03:08 <Micen_> I only ever logged on once. I missed the minecraft train. 
23:03:17 <Camail> by a few years
23:03:22 <Camail> that was very early
23:03:24 <Dot`> micen, even i missed it
23:03:32 <Micen_> oh jeeze
23:03:51 <DuB`> I made a 4-story spa with a waterfall in the lobby
23:03:52 <DuB`> wew
23:04:08 <skram> that was pretty good
23:04:12 <Camail> which took you the entire life of the server to build
23:04:18 <Camail> was it ever finished?
23:04:28 <Zounds> I made pony gohlein way out in the desert too
23:04:31 <DuB`> The exterior, yes :P Nothing inside
23:04:35 <Dot`> lol
23:04:36 <Camail> yea dub was that hipster who didnt care about the main 6
23:04:42 <Zounds> nice little place to enchant / feed / store stuff
23:04:48 <Zounds> yeah he was a spa pony guy
23:05:14 <skram> i made a tower that was perpetually on fire
23:05:14 <Dot`> though deep down dub knows zecora is best
23:05:17 <skram> with a pinkie shrine
23:05:28 <Camail> i did the town hall, nether portal, moon cannon, hole
23:05:29 <Camail> was fun
23:05:39 <skram> good ol moon cannon
23:05:42 <Micen_> Dot I will give you Zecora is best zebra. 
23:05:56 <Micen_> thats about as far as it goes. 
23:06:09 <Camail> i did make a pinkie pie basilica that i was planning on building
23:06:17 <Camail> but that was towards the end
23:06:42 <skram> zebras are all enemies, micen
23:06:54 <Camail> skram dont be racist
23:07:02 <skram> they destroyed the world, camail
23:07:06 <Dot`> he is just jelous
23:07:23 <DuB`> Hey that's not true Cam, I was all for rarity! 
23:07:33 <skram> right
23:07:36 <skram> the scarf fetish
23:07:51 <Dot`> ?scarf
23:07:52 <Camail> you didnt build a fashion store
23:07:54 <Zounds> Rarity pretty goo pone
23:07:56 <Camail> you build a mega spa
23:07:59 <Zounds> good pone*
23:08:05 <Camail> if you HAD to choose a main, it was rarity
23:08:16 <DuB`> Hmmm suppose so
23:08:16 <Camail> but you were rabid for spa
23:08:25 <Zounds> you were, I remember it
23:10:43 <Zounds> wonder if ive still got my skin somewhere
23:11:16 <DuB`> Apparently in season 9, "both Aloe and Lotus Blossom get brainwashed by King Sombra into invading Canterlot." Sounds exciting
23:11:17 <DuB`> Haha
23:11:44 <Zounds> I was quite proud of it, I was a cheerilee knockoff with a chequered scarf and a wineglass cutie mark
23:11:54 <Dot`> just the 2 of them dub?

23:24:14 <Zounds> I liked that guy
23:24:29 <Zounds> or girl, I forget how things ended up
23:24:40 <Zounds> didn't mean to make that sound so insensitive btw
23:24:44 <Kittybunny> Yeah pretty cool. Too bad he/her disappeared.
23:25:02 <skram> this is a slapper runbun
23:25:10 <Kittybunny> I agree.
23:25:12 <skram> ya divvies was a cool sort
23:26:08 <Kittybunny> Private profile on steam, even to friends. Last online last year though O:
23:27:02 <Zounds> https://i.imgur.com/c4cXR.jpg they could craft a fine pon
23:28:01 <Kittybunny> I figured that maybe Wikt was following diversee on twitter but I can't check as I don't have a twitter account myself. Boo.
23:29:41 <Zounds> gary was close to them at least back in the day
23:29:56 <Zounds> I could poke him but if divvies wants to be private i'll let 'em
23:30:14 <skram> i think they drew lewd pictures for garys horse porn
23:30:36 <Zounds> they did do lewds but I dunno if they did directly for gary
23:30:56 <Zounds> 'tis possible though =P
23:31:32 <Zounds> the godfather of sc2 micro had a way of convincing peope
