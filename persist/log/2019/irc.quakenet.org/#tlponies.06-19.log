09:53:11 <Runbunny> It's important to have one additional sword in the mouth if you drop any of the swords in your hands and you need to stab someone.
09:53:13 <reification> having kept well away from somalia i have yet to meet any bun
09:53:36 <reification> oh i see

12:50:52 <DoT|Phone> though his 30 minutes helping me probably cost the company more than I am worth for a week
13:12:27 <skram> nonsense
13:12:30 <skram> what was wrong pal
13:19:20 <DoT|Phone> it's embarrassing!
13:19:53 <skram> it usually is
13:20:01 <DoT|Phone> I added some intake fans months ago but they where not in an area that was being read by the PLC
13:20:15 <DoT|Phone> so earlier today I added that section to the read
13:20:48 <DoT|Phone> and those intake fans variable was conflicting and overwriting another sections instruments
13:21:41 <skram> what kind of plc are you using
13:21:43 <skram> siemens?
13:21:48 <DoT|Phone> but I forgot ladder logic doesn't display in the same way as c++ so couldn't understand why bits that should be active where off

13:26:25 <skram> field IO over fieldbus and stuff

13:27:41 <DoT|Phone> if you ever want a control systems job Skram I can probably get you one, you know a lot more than me lol and they hired me
13:28:00 <DoT|Phone> I don't even know stay field IO is
13:28:12 <DoT|Phone> I just connect dots on a screen

14:09:17 <Zounds> football season is over so less
14:14:05 <Zounds> got a v busy weekend coming up but hopefully no hooligans
14:17:04 <Zounds> I'm worried with hooligans that one day I'm finally gonna lose my composure and break their neck or something
14:17:11 <Zounds> And i'm 100% not kidding about that >.>
14:18:35 <Zounds> But hopefully wont be doing this job for too much longer. got some plans in motion to move into the control room
14:18:48 <Zounds> if it works out that would be great
14:24:31 <DoT|Phone> nice
14:24:38 <DoT|Phone> the control room thing
14:24:55 <DoT|Phone> though breaking necks is impressive
14:33:13 <BioPone> Stronk lad
14:34:44 <Zounds> Add adrenaline and remove the inhibition and breaking necks becomes easier
14:35:15 <Zounds> Or so I would guess. I haven't broken anybodies neck
14:35:40 <Zounds> Maybe I'd have to work at it for a while

19:14:30 <Camail> Cane if someone wanted to they could make a lot of money flipping some of these essences
19:14:38 <Camail> i hate playing markets, but the numbers are there
19:15:37 <Camail> many parts of this game are self regulating, but you could pretty easily create a bot to fleece a lot of people...not getting banned is the tricky part
19:18:17 <Camail> because right now you can get screaming dreads for around 5c very easily, but the cheapest deafening is 50, at minimum you make a 5c profit
19:18:33 <Camail> very quickly turning to a 10-20c profit with literally 0 effort
19:30:01 <Camail> DoT`  do you have a decent 5 link chest yet
