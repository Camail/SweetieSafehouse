16:05:48 <Runbunny> DuB`, There were a ton of unfortunate mishaps.
16:06:32 <Runbunny> Like supernova -> flames on the ground -> supernova second wave -> death.
16:06:41 <skraam> Yeah they kept attacking us
16:07:05 <Runbunny> Like getting pushed into flames on ground, start burning and get stunned at the same time.
16:07:31 <Runbunny> I did another lunastra after you left Jonas.
16:07:34 <Dot`> why you standing in the flames runbun?
16:07:38 <Dot`> dont do that
16:07:48 <Runbunny> No no I get pushed into the flames.
16:07:50 <skraam> are you saying that i was dragging us down runbun
16:08:34 <Runbunny> No.
16:08:51 <Rawr|Fone> Yes
16:09:57 <Runbunny> We can hope for lunastra changes in Ice borne.
16:10:18 <skraam> i hope they just delete her instead
16:11:09 <DuB`> I have bad news for you
16:11:21 <DuB`> I'm pretty sure master rank lunastra is pretty much like fighting the AT version
