02:01:06 <Runbunny> Failed 3-4 times on AT KT at pursuit 6 :/
02:01:26 <Runbunny> Should probably just sleep.
02:01:59 <Camail> with 3 randos?
02:02:14 <Camail> it's a hard fight with people who dont do it right
02:02:41 <Camail> but also sleep will heal all
02:03:00 <Runbunny> Yeah, we got area 4 every time.
02:03:25 <Runbunny> But someone just die in area 2 every time and stuff.
02:04:36 <Camail> carting on kt is always a bummer

10:10:23 <Dot`> ive been paddling many times and not tipped over
10:10:30 <Dot`> you always get a bit wet though
10:12:13 <skram> how do you get in it without falling over
10:12:35 <Dot`> carefully?

10:35:56 <Runbunny> Hai
10:37:08 <Runbunny> Dot what are you doing home?
10:37:20 <Dot`> working!
10:37:36 <Dot`> thats a lie i finished what i had set aside to do today
10:37:39 <Runbunny> Carry on.
10:37:42 <Runbunny> O:
10:37:44 <Dot`> now im browsing the internet
10:37:55 <Runbunny> Have you made them cancel brexit yet?
10:38:40 <Dot`> no need, it will never happen
10:38:53 <Dot`> it will just drag on till the econmy collapses
10:39:39 <Runbunny> I guess that's a better scenario than brexit.
10:40:21 <reification> currently you can enjoy watching various opposition parties come up with various excuses not to have an election
10:43:14 <Runbunny> Isn't Germany getting fed up with it?
10:44:05 <reification> the overwhelming feeling generally is just get it over with
10:44:33 <reification> of course even passing this withdrawal agreement would only really be a first step
10:50:54 <reification> current situation not really surprising, EU referenda "no" results never get respected unless there is no wiggle room (euro currency membership)

15:36:51 <Runbunny> Camail, I found why I ditched the gunlance.
15:37:01 <Runbunny> I don't have the streamstones to augment it :/
15:37:19 <Camail> rip
15:37:49 <Camail> are tempered dragon investigations still the best way to get them
15:38:18 <Runbunny> Probably. Unless there's some event I don't know about.
15:39:09 <Camail> augmenting is nice, but it's not like a make or break for most fights
15:39:36 <Camail> it's useful when you're fighting ATs i would say
15:40:45 <Runbunny> Health regen on long gunlances mean that you with the stone whatever mantle can just tank the monster and keep firing your shells.
15:44:53 <Camail> meh, if you only want to play it so you don't have to interact with the fights then yea i guess it's necessary
15:49:16 <Runbunny> I just want to clap on some monsters :D
15:53:34 <Camail> you gotta grind it out before the expansion
15:55:10 <Runbunny> Yes.
15:55:15 <Runbunny> Looking forward to that!
16:10:15 <Camail> we can do at kt or something once dub gets home
16:10:23 <Camail> maybe some investigations
