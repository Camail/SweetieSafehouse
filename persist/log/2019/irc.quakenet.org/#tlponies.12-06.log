00:01:56 <Dot`> thanks
00:02:12 <skram> im a cat person this time DuB`
00:02:16 <skram> its your turn to be the dwarf
00:02:24 <Micen> I was right!
00:02:49 <Micen> when i was handling the editing of the pic i said it was you skram!
00:02:56 <Micen> dot was making me question it 
00:03:09 <skram> what? i like cats
00:03:28 <Micen> That was my thought as well
00:03:31 <skram> maybe we shoulda homebrewed a half dwarf tabaxi
00:03:32 <Dot`> skram, the edited image is in disocrd
00:03:38 <skram> marvelous
00:03:42 <Dot`> didnt want to ping you here and tip micen off
00:03:43 <skram> hat details to follow
00:03:53 <DuB`> lul
00:03:54 <Dot`> please check if it meets standards
00:04:12 <DuB`> I ALMOST made a dorf, skram, but half-orcs are also v tuff strong
00:04:16 <skram> very dapper
00:04:16 <DuB`> Well, I still could
00:04:22 <skram> hol up
00:04:23 <Micen> I have ate, are there mons to hunt?
00:04:34 <skram> are you saying that dwarfs are not tuff&strong??
00:04:50 <Dot`> dub, dorf battle master fighter with commanding strike
00:04:57 <Runbunny> there are always monsters to hunter.
00:04:59 <Dot`> so skram can do 2 sneak attacks pls
00:05:02 <Runbunny> hunt*
00:05:05 <DuB`> What if
00:05:10 <DuB`> I just want max ac+hp
00:05:11 <DuB`> :P
00:05:19 <DuB`> Mountain dorf mebbe
00:05:33 <Dot`> then you would be a barb with full plate
00:05:41 <Micen> Dot sneak attack is once per turn. 
00:05:51 <Dot`> once per turn yes, not once per round
00:05:52 <Rawr|Fone> Runbunny it's time to go to bed
00:06:00 <Micen> oh!
00:06:19 <Dot`> yea, you can sneal attack on AoO
00:06:24 <Dot`> sneak attack too
00:06:32 <Micen> that sounds dumb
00:06:52 <Runbunny> Not quite yet Henrik :/
00:07:11 <Dot`> you can check the rules on me micen, but im pretty sure
00:07:20 <Dot`> rawr, why you still up
00:07:44 <Rawr|Fone> I just woke up 
00:07:58 <Rawr|Fone> Going back to sleep
00:08:14 <Dot`> gl rawr <3
00:08:29 <Rawr|Fone> Just wanted to see what my favorite pons are up to
00:08:36 <Micen> yes, you can sneak attack out of turn
00:08:40 <Dot`> your the best rawr
00:09:03 <Rawr|Fone> No you dot ‚ù§‚ù§
00:09:07 <Dot`> <3
00:09:55 <Camail> Dot`  RAW it says once per turn, not once on your turn. I'd personally dm-errata that to once on your turn
00:10:13 <Camail> if not you get into some ambiguous unfun player stuff
00:11:04 <Camail> because if you dnt do that you could sneak attack with your standard action, then sneak attack on someone else's turn with a reaction AoO
00:11:12 <Camail> which is dumb
00:12:09 <Dot`> i never see it used, but it allows for player combos and team work i think
00:12:18 <DuB`> Oh yah I had forgotten about the bonuses from hill/mountain variant on dorfs, maybe I ditch half-orc...
00:14:03 <Camail> Dot` if you wanna do combos hold your standard action, that seems more obviously balanced
00:17:41 <Dot`> rogues are squishy and only have 1 attack, if he is staying in combat and the fighter uses commanding strike there are give and takes happening there so the players can do something together
00:18:12 <Camail> yea, and do 200% of their intended damage
00:18:21 <Camail> they have a disengage action almost for free
00:18:46 <Dot`> players are not balanced, the game is designed that they are powerful, and even then I can kill them anytime i want
00:18:52 <Camail> sneak attack is meant to be used once per round, isn't that obvious
00:18:56 <Dot`> the rogue cant disengage if he stays there
00:19:43 <Dot`> https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/rules-answers-february-2016
00:20:10 <Dot`> seems they intend it can be used more
00:20:24 <reification> hmmm i checked z32o discord and it has announcement that implies massive life changes
00:20:51 <reification> twitter bio says she/her
00:20:57 <reification> that would explain it
00:21:11 <Camail> weren't they married
00:21:22 <reification> i think so cam
00:21:24 <Dot`> I hope it works out for her then
00:21:24 <skram> how does that explain the furry porn
00:21:26 <Dot`> and yes cam
00:21:29 <Dot`> they had a cat
00:21:48 <reification> the fursona arrived like a year ago skram
00:21:57 <reification> called derpy dot
00:22:06 <Camail> ugh
00:22:10 <Dot`> yea, that was it
00:22:30 <skram> ive not been paying attention at all i guess
00:23:57 <Camail> the fursona part is w/e
00:24:03 <Camail> naming it after a pony is fucking boring
00:24:39 <Dot`> the cats name was derpy
00:25:18 <Camail> oh, reif's messages confused me
00:25:46 <Camail> i thought the names the character "derpy dot"
00:25:55 <Camail> which gave me a distinct chill down my spine
00:26:01 <Dot`> HAHA
00:26:04 <reification> lol
00:26:14 <DuB`> Same actually lol
00:26:16 <Dot`> that would make me uncomfortable
00:26:42 <Camail> no you see my disgust
00:26:46 <Camail> now*
00:30:43 <skram> well then
00:30:49 <skram> whats the name of your fursona camail
00:31:02 <Camail> i never put in the time to make one
00:31:21 <Camail> nor have i felt the need for that particular escape
00:31:38 <Golly> is that a new thing like a zombie plan
00:31:48 <Golly> do we need a plan for furries
00:31:59 <Dot`> dont the guns work for that too?
00:32:26 <skram> spray bottle
00:32:59 <skram> or i guess a flail but with a buttplug attached to a tail
00:33:54 <Golly> i think that would work better if you throw it like a distraction
00:34:10 <skram> i guess
00:34:14 <skram> what happens if you get bitten?
00:34:40 <Micen> Same thing that happens in zombie movies
00:34:54 <Dot`> you hide it?
00:35:07 <DuB`> And then get shot later
00:35:12 <Micen> and then when the group least suspects is you turn
00:35:18 <skram> and after a while you start thinkin bout yiffing
00:35:20 <Golly> haha right up untill you start leg humpin
00:35:22 <skram> then its too late
00:38:54 <Golly> yiff in hell - starring bruce campbell
00:39:21 <skram> lol
00:39:22 <skram> perfect
00:45:11 <Camail> skram are you going to sleep yet
