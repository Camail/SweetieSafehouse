00:00:15 <DoT`> good to hear dub
00:02:03 <DuB`> Wandered Met museum for 90 minutes or so then she had plans with sister so we just grabbed a quick ice cream snack
00:08:51 <Bio> you are disgustingly anime irl
00:08:56 <Bio> good work sir
00:11:18 <skrm> its not anime until you accidentally fall on top of her and grope her tiddies, Bio 
00:12:17 <Bio> he didn't say it didn't happen
00:12:45 <skrm> true
00:17:20 <DoT`> and skram, thats only in the king of anime you read
00:17:30 <DoT`> you should go back and watch more k-on
00:17:37 <DoT`> you need more wholesome
00:20:34 <DuB`> Tonikaku Cawaii for peak healthy relationship pure wholesomeness
00:27:09 <Camail> dot is lohse in your party
00:27:20 <Camail> she was my character, quite fun
00:27:39 <DoT`> yea , friend has her
00:28:23 <Camail> woo
00:28:32 <Camail> she has the best story imo
00:28:54 <Camail> oh dub did you ever beat dos2?
00:29:02 <Camail> i know you were playing yandere elf
00:29:11 <DuB`> I need to go finish
00:29:21 <DuB`> Stopped when pc died and haven't gotten back to it
00:29:37 <Camail> we should crash dot's campaign

00:32:07 <Camail> she's seen everything
00:32:42 <skrm> e v e r y t h i n g
00:33:19 <skrm> also dub i dont think getting married on first date is to be considered peak healthy relationship tbh
00:33:36 <Camail> it is for mormons
00:33:42 <DuB`> lul
00:33:49 <DuB`> The AFTER that part, skram :P
00:34:20 <DuB`> It's the opposite of all the other manga/anime where the whole plot is people just misunderstanding each other for 3 years and then finally going on their first date in the last episode!
00:36:16 <skrm> You mean you dont want 187 chapters of overused tropes about people being hella dense?
00:36:34 <DuB`> v hate
00:37:35 <skrm> i get it
00:38:32 <skrm> reminds me a little too much of middle school
00:39:53 <Camail> most media sucks
00:39:59 <Camail> anyone can make it so its usually bad
00:40:04 <Camail> but there's some really good things
00:40:13 <Camail> like ping pong the animation
00:40:32 <Camail> megalobox was good
00:42:01 <Camail> romantic anime is trash
00:42:09 <Camail> because japan's views on relationships are so fucked
00:45:58 <DuB`> A country doesn't lose 1/3 of its population over 50 years by accident
00:46:16 <DuB`> Er, for no reason I guess is a better wording\
00:46:28 <Camail> oops i accidently didnt have sex
00:46:29 <Camail> my b
00:46:31 <skrm> its mostly due to a lack of accidents 
00:46:37 <DuB`> lol
00:47:34 <Camail> skram when are you getting home
00:47:37 <skrm> well if you work 30 hours a day you're not gonna have time to make the babby
00:47:44 <skrm> in like 4 hours cam
00:47:49 <Camail> ugggh
00:47:54 <Camail> that's forever
00:48:24 <skrm> i knoooow
00:49:38 <DuB`> Neeearly at the point where I can leave my a/c off during the night comfortable, will be nice
00:49:49 <DuB`> It's just a bit too loud
00:50:19 <skrm> i cant sleep without the noise of a fan anymore
00:50:49 <DuB`> I'm same, I'll switch to a small fan I have
00:51:13 <Camail> if i could sleep in a noise cancellation room that'd be great
00:51:17 <Camail> i want to hear my blood move
00:51:31 <DuB`> ach
00:55:22 <skrm> that sounds terrible, clambail
00:56:03 <skrm> i got like 9 projects line up for my next week off

01:54:43 <DuB`> Natural gas (methane) is a common fuel for ranges and stovetops, but most torches used for cooking are fueled by propane or butane. Fuels like oxyacetylene and MAPP gas, however, typically burn hotter and thus can impart a larger amount of heat to the food for a faster sear.
01:54:46 <DuB`> ... maybe

06:18:11 <Camail> skram i just made a pretty damn good item
06:18:58 <Camail> i think it's one of a kind
06:19:10 <Camail> it's not mirror tier but its real good
06:19:26 <Camail> hell it might be worth a mirror i dunno, i doubt it
06:47:28 <skram> whats a mirror cam
06:47:47 <Camail> mirror of kalandra, the ultimate currency
06:47:55 <Camail> they're roughly 100 exalts
06:47:59 <Camail> exalts are 150 chaos
06:48:04 <Camail> so 15000 chaos
06:48:23 <skram> oh wow
06:48:24 <Camail> well this league mirrors have gone for 180 ex
06:48:29 <Camail> so like 30k+ chaos
06:49:13 <Camail> at their most expensive mid-league it would've been 30.6k chaos
06:50:55 <skram> is it worth using at all or is it just worth a lot of money because its very rare
07:03:00 <Camail> its very useful because it adds a ton of range to cyclone
07:03:08 <Camail> also its nearly perfectly rolled
07:03:13 <Camail> and its 28% quality
07:03:18 <Camail> AND 3 white sockets
07:03:23 <Camail> it's very very very good
07:03:41 <Camail> the corrupt, the vorici, the hillock, and the divines all hit nearly perfectly
07:03:57 <Camail> and on a fairly rare and top tier unique
