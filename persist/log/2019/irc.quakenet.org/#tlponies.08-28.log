01:27:40 <Camail> why'd you get it for free
01:34:48 <DuB`> Key came with gpu purchase
01:34:53 <DuB`> Also new wolfenstein
01:36:24 <Camail> there are cheaper ways to get free stuff, dub
01:36:29 <Camail> you dont have to buy a new card every time
01:36:55 <skrma> i dont know, almost makes that 1000 dollar gpu worth it
01:37:13 <DuB`> If $1200 is free then I am certainly doing things wrong
01:40:34 <Camail> skram go home and sleep

22:30:50 <skrma> why not dot
22:31:08 <skrma> you have a job now to feed your plastic figurine addiction
22:31:32 <DoT`>  i can pay rent and buy food
22:32:25 <DoT`>  i also have a large need for books
22:32:28 <DoT`> and cheese
22:32:37 <skrma> a man of vices, you are
22:32:42 <Runbunny> Dot is eating books with cheese.
22:32:58 <skrma> cant you just buy books about cheese instead

22:33:48 <CockRoach|42> skrma: i dunno... it looks like a real giraffe
22:34:00 <CockRoach|42> dont trust everything you read
22:34:34 <skrma> i dont know
22:34:35 <DoT`> it has a neck and girafes are widely known to have necks
22:34:44 <skrma> i want to trust you on this but you told me not to, CR
22:35:17 <CockRoach|42> DoT`: that is very reasonable
22:45:56 <Rawr|Fone> Dot is the expert after all
