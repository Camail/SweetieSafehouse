15:49:28 <BioPhone> I certainly ask my self what the fug when being exposed to anime
15:51:45 <Dot`> i tihnk bio secretly wat hes all the anime
15:53:41 <BioPhone> False and slander
15:57:15 <BioPhone> You will be hearing from my lawyer, Phoenix Wright
15:59:21 <skrm> OBJECTION
15:59:39 <skrm> mlp is basically anime but with horses
16:02:04 <skrm> i am serious though mr dot, you should try it
16:04:55 <Dot`> ill  onsider it
16:05:28 <Dot`> i dont want to go do a driving lesson today skram, im very tired
16:07:14 <skrm> ooh i didnt know you were getting your license
16:07:28 <skrm> its a useful skill toi have though
16:07:42 <skrm> you could drive to france and then through denmark and visit
16:08:58 <Camail> and we never saw dot again
16:09:14 <Dot`> no one would willingly drive to france
16:09:18 <skrm> driving is pretty easy, you just point where you wanna go with the middle donut and then use the foot buttons to increase rate of vrooms
16:09:36 <skrm> you're not driving TO france, you're driving THROUGH france
16:09:40 <skrm> theres a difference
16:09:59 <Dot`> i havnt crashed yet
16:10:06 <Dot`> but im tired today, so maybe, we will see

22:20:20 <Runbunny> Fake love letter gacha.
22:20:54 <reification> wow
22:23:09 <skram> anders whats gacha
22:23:11 <skram> and also
22:23:16 <skram> what is this
22:24:17 <Zounds> how do you get to the point you'll collect fake love letters
22:28:21 <Zounds> are they playing catch up on the teenage romance they missed out because of watching too much anime
22:28:48 <DuB`> I'd imagine something like that
22:30:04 <reification> skram gatcha is vending machine + rng
22:34:03 <Zounds> also used to describe those games that are just digital vending machines for anime girl jpegs
22:43:49 <Zounds> I wrote a love letter once when I was about 16
22:44:00 <Zounds> I thought it was pretty good but I can only imagine how terrible it was
22:48:23 <Runbunny> I have never written a love letter.
22:48:45 <Runbunny> No reason too when you're already condemmed by gods and humans alike.
22:49:22 <Dot`> life is suffering runbun
22:49:31 <Runbunny> It's not that bad Dot.
22:51:20 <Runbunny> I have been in love a few times. It was horrible, every single time.
22:51:59 <reification> maybe dot is just being very buddhist
22:53:52 <Runbunny> Buddhism isn't about life being suffering, is it?
22:54:21 <Zounds> suffering and the end of suffering
22:54:34 <Runbunny> I might be mixing it up with taoism.
22:55:36 <Zounds> I think "suffering" is playing fast and loose the the translations though
22:56:52 <reification> suffering is the first of the four noble truths
22:58:12 <reification> (yes it progresses to the cause and how to end)
