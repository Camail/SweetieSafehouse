10:30:22 <DoT`> reif rief
10:34:00 <DoT`> skram why so rude
10:37:29 <DoT`> rawr is sweden ok? https://imgur.com/gallery/VAwNLRS
10:38:16 <skram> this cant be real
10:38:24 <skram> how do i activate my genitals, DoT`?
10:38:28 <DoT`> probably not
10:38:37 <DoT`> just based on russia
10:38:55 <DoT`> shoul dbe cheeki breeki
10:40:07 <skram> dot why is EXPLOSION not on this list
10:41:28 <DoT`> isnt it just delayed fierball?
10:41:43 <skram> its like fireball in all caps I guess
10:43:05 <DoT`> there is a spell called delayed fireball
10:43:25 <DoT`> high level and the longer you leave it the stronger it gets up to a certain amount
10:43:39 <skram> oh i see
10:45:10 <DoT`> copy paste spell time
10:45:41 <DoT`> nope, pdf copying is being worst than normal
10:46:18 <DoT`> well, its 7th level, 12d6 base + 1df  every 6 seconds up to a minute
10:46:22 <DoT`> 1d6
10:46:32 <DoT`> so max of 22d6
10:46:46 <skram> thats only 10 rounds
10:46:57 <skram> avg damage ~100
10:47:02 <skram> thats like 2 barbarian turns
10:47:53 <DoT`> well if your barbarian has a op sword that smites every round, sure
10:48:01 <skram> its the only way to live
10:48:03 <DoT`> every attack*
10:48:11 <skram> though i guess fireball has a 10(?)ft radius
10:48:35 <DoT`> 20 ft 
10:52:16 <DoT`> high level monk > high level barb though still i think
10:54:22 <skram> monks are the worst
10:54:29 <skram> cursed dice
10:54:51 <DoT`> you had a rough session last week
10:55:22 <DoT`> and you also play monk a lot like its a barb and at low levels monk are squishy
10:55:24 <DoT`> its a tough life
10:55:30 <skram> im gonna pretend to roll my dice irl and just fudge the numbers
10:55:37 <DoT`> ok
10:55:40 <skram> wow! a nat 20 AGAIN! wew im so lucky
10:55:56 <DoT`> well after the number of 1's you rolled last session
10:56:03 <skram> haha
10:56:10 <DoT`> anything under 10 nat 20's wont seem absurd
