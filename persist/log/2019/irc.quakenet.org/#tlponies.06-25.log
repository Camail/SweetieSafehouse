00:05:59 <reification> night all
00:43:53 <Camail> if quake had more tournaments i could see it gaining momentum
00:44:29 <Camail> it's fun to watch, liquid is the best at it, it just doesn't get any noise
02:36:51 <Camail> Cane people want them so they can make cyclone cost 0 mana, and slayer cyclone is the most popular casual build in this league
02:37:08 <Camail> get all those sexy auras in
02:37:20 <Cane> Aha. Mmm, delicious.
02:37:22 <Camail> and melee is too far away from EB
03:24:48 <Cane> Well okay then, Vaal Temple is impossible.
03:24:55 <Cane> Good to know.
03:24:58 <Cane> Can do all content my ass.
03:49:02 <Camail> vaal temple is really hard
03:49:19 <Camail> and with minions it's evne ahrder because you dont choose who dies
03:50:41 <Camail> i paid a guy for the carry, i killed the wrong 2 and couldn't tank the phys dmg
03:58:11 <Cane> I have to be so careful with my summon skeletons to make sure it takes down the proper target.
06:39:04 <Camail> i just did like 10 glaciers and i have 100 chisels
06:39:17 <Camail> white map farming is really good...

11:20:15 <DoT|Phone> but then I was told today all westermo products are named after animals from Sweden
11:20:55 <DoT|Phone> Norway is far more dangerous than I thought!
11:21:12 <DoT|Phone> I hope you always wear your high vis jacket
11:21:39 <skram> Lynx are super duper shy though, i've never actually seen one
11:41:01 <Golly> norwegian animals so shy i couldnt even see them at the zoo
11:42:12 <DoT|Phone> Lol. empty zoos sounds like a great scam.
11:42:31 <DoT|Phone> "no no, they are there, just shy. be patient"
11:43:00 <Golly> throw out some crumbs and be a zoo with squirrels and pigeons and stuff

20:02:33 <Camail> Cane hey so you can mindlessly farm glacier or city square if you buy the sextants to make it uncomplete
20:02:51 <Camail> i've been doing glacier and got 2 ex in like 20 maps
20:07:43 <Cane> I don't know what that means.
20:13:52 <Camail> so you need 3 things
20:14:00 <Camail> a map you want to farm
20:14:27 <Camail> a shaper orb of the neighboring next tier and an elder orb of the other neighbor
20:14:45 <Camail> then you uncomplete all other maps of your farming maps tier
20:15:01 <Camail> this is designed to make every map drop roll as your chosen map
20:15:05 <Camail> or a tier 1
20:15:31 <Camail> i uncompleted all tier 2s and 3s that aren't glacier
20:15:48 <Camail> elder orbed laylines and shaped mausoleum
20:16:29 <Camail> it sustains itself REALLY easily, and the legion drops are really good on glacier
21:06:37 <skrm> peace
21:19:11 <Camail> i'm thinking my exalt drops are from incubators

22:52:18 <Cane> Welp, there goes ~80 chaos. FML.
22:52:20 <Cane> Fossil crafting.
22:52:38 <Cane> I think I used up my fossil luck on the first item I ever made.
22:52:56 <Cane> My stupidly good +1 spectre life/res/max movement speed boots would probably go for ~5 ex if I didn't need them so badly.
22:53:08 <Cane> Everything else I've fossil crafted has been a horrible disappointment.
22:55:19 <Camail> that's how it is on this bitch of an earth
22:55:41 <Camail> i've never went deep on crafting
22:56:27 <Cane> You can craft abyssal jewels, which is an interesting move.
22:56:35 <Cane> And jewels in general.
22:56:50 <Cane> And you can 30% quality a map if you're an insane person.
