15:47:22 <skram> i wish
15:47:47 <Camail> i thought you had this week off
15:47:53 <Camail> or was it weekends
15:48:06 <skram> no i do
15:48:10 <skram> i just want to argue forever
15:48:15 <Camail> you fuckin dwarf
15:48:23 <skram> how fuckin dare you
15:48:52 <Camail> it was a compliment
15:49:07 <skram> its not a compliment if you put fuck in it
15:49:24 <Camail> that's just not true
15:49:30 <Micen> but what if it were a fuckin compliment from cam?
15:49:42 <Camail> lots of people enjoy putting a fuck in
15:49:46 <skram> i wouldnt trust it
15:50:53 <Micen> any of you want to hunt some monsters?
15:51:15 <skram> fur is murder, micen
15:51:53 <skram> what mons are you hunting tho
15:51:56 <Micen> glorious soft, warm murder. 
15:52:32 <Micen> i have a 2 person tempered Pink Rathian (4 purple box reward)  
15:52:40 <skram> sold
15:53:08 <Micen> in the tlp discord
15:54:20 <BioPhone> Dont get bit skrms
15:55:37 <Camail> and if you do, dont get bit a lot
17:23:16 <Camail> skram Micen  how'd the hunt go
17:23:29 <Camail> any rubies
17:25:44 <Micen> sadly no. but i did get my thing to unlock augments.
17:25:54 <Micen> at least no rubies for me :(
17:26:03 <Micen> Skram went to go get food
17:32:40 <Camail> getting a streamstone for your main weapon is more rare
17:32:44 <Camail> so that's honestly better
17:32:54 <Camail> can't buy those
17:35:51 <Micen> it wasnt for my main weapon
17:36:07 <Micen> it was a bowgun.  but it unlocked the other stuff for me to remove armor level cap
17:36:10 <Micen> so ill take it
17:37:02 <Camail> ah, that's convenient
17:37:49 <Micen> and it was right as i capped all my armor as well.
