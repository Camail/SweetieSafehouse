08:04:08 <Runbunny> Hai.
08:04:30 <Runbunny> I went and did a short run this morning.
08:04:58 <Runbunny> The time has come to reclaim lost power.
08:14:32 <Rawr|Phone> Are you going to start going to the gym anders
08:18:45 <DoT|Phone1> why pay when you can just do push ups at home and go for runs
08:20:56 <Runbunny> I have considered it yeah.
08:21:47 <Rawr|Phone> Dot push ups are the most overrated thing in the world compared to real strength training
08:23:37 <Runbunny> Henrik.
08:23:50 <Runbunny> "To be the best, you gotta pump the chest"
08:25:08 <Rawr|Phone> Well it rhymes so I guess it has to be true
08:25:26 <Rawr|Phone> I don't think push ups are the best way to do that though
08:26:08 <Runbunny> I have some dumbbells I wave around a bit every day.
08:28:43 <Rawr|Phone> It's better than nothing
08:29:04 <Rawr|Phone> But honestly you can't come close to what training with a barbell and weights does

15:45:55 <DoT`> its a power plant though
15:46:00 <DoT`> they EXPLODE
15:46:37 <skrm> we got these things called safety valves
15:46:39 <skrm> they're valves
15:46:41 <skrm> for safety
15:46:53 <DoT`> are they the type that cause the explosion?
15:47:11 <skrm> of course not
15:47:17 <skrm> WTE furnaces dont explode
15:47:30 <DoT`> sure sure
15:48:50 <Golly> youre both delusional
15:49:27 <Runbunny> Delightfully delusional.
15:51:24 <skrm> Comrade Benny assured me so. He would know, he's DANISH.
15:52:06 <Runbunny> I am fully convinced that he thinks you delusional as well.
16:00:31 <reification> if you're making enough energy to be a power plant, you're making enough energy for an explosion
