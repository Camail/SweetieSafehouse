13:02:32 <skram> zounds you old rascal
13:04:19 <Zounds> how r u
13:05:19 <skram> i slept too much and now i feel like a zombie
13:05:27 <skram> i'd give it a 4 tbh
13:05:34 <skram> hows life in glasgow
13:12:13 <Zounds> its alright
13:16:11 <Zounds> what should I get by brother for his birthday skram 
13:16:19 <Zounds> my*
13:19:40 <skram> hmmm
13:20:14 <skram> well i dont know what your brother likes but im getting that ahegao sweater for my brother
13:21:35 <Zounds> hm he'd probably get a laugh out of something like that
13:22:26 <skram> is your brother older or younger
13:23:03 <Zounds> he's turning 32
13:23:14 <Zounds> an ahegao sweater would be funny but I don't think I'd actually get him one
13:25:08 <skram> well i'd refrain from getting giftcards etc
13:25:22 <skram> giftcards are a curse unless its something specifically asked for
13:26:30 <skram> like i have 50 pounds or so in a giftcard in a shop where i dont want or need anything but its gonna run out at some point and i cant just not use them so then im gonna have to buy something i dont need or want just to break out of this curse my siblings put on me
13:26:38 <Zounds> he doesn't drink or i'd just get him a bottle of something nice
13:26:52 <Zounds> he makes things complicated
13:27:42 <skram> alcohol is the ol fallback
13:28:39 <skram> you should bake him a cake, zounds
13:29:47 <Zounds> this is something I could do
13:31:28 <skram> i made some chocolate cake with a whiskey sauce and cream some time ago, would recommend
