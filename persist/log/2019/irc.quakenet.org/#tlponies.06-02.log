00:04:46 <Dot`> yea rawr, its very sad
00:04:57 <Rawr|Fone> üò•
00:05:43 <Camail> the start of sao is supposedly strong
00:06:03 <Camail> then halfway through s1 it becomes trash cans, then the rest of the seasons just burn whatever bridges they made
00:06:35 <skram> we will see
00:06:38 <skram> i love trash though
00:06:48 <Dot`> yea, half way though s1 there is a whole, adopt a child and be parents thing, then the second game tihng
00:07:04 <skram> she DIED and it was S A D
00:07:24 <Dot`> oh did she? i dont recall, RIP
00:07:41 <skram> its ok tho, she got better in ELF GAME EDITION

00:09:21 <Rawr|Fone> Sounds nerdy
00:09:32 <Dot`> dont look rawr, its depravity
00:09:33 <skram> you're not wrong
00:09:53 <Rawr|Fone> I will try to stay clear dot
00:10:22 <Rawr|Fone> Well you are quite a nerdpon skram, so I guess it fits
00:10:25 <Dot`> just go look at Girls und Panzer rawr, its the only one that matters
00:11:45 <Crisium> anime is trash
00:11:53 <Dot`> indeed
00:12:10 <skram> a mistake, no doubt
00:12:56 <Rawr|Fone> I'm gonna go ahead and skip that one too dot
00:13:07 <Dot`> your loss rawr

13:57:38 <skram> i kinda want ramen but i dont wanna spend 9 hours making broth
13:57:47 <skram> well, ill put parmesan on
13:58:18 <Dot`> ramen skram? have you been staring at anime food all day?
13:58:28 <skram> not yet
13:58:51 <skram> actually i saw a howtobasic video on it and it looked friggin delicious
13:59:52 <Zounds> y'know what's good
13:59:58 <Zounds> kimchi stew
14:00:17 <Dot`> buried months old cabbage?
14:00:30 <skram> never had kimchi anything

14:01:56 <Zounds> Look at this country bumpkin who doesn't keep jars of kimchi stored at all times
14:02:36 <skram> having jars of kimchi sounds more like a country bumpkin thing honestly
14:03:03 <Zounds> you have a point really
14:03:12 <Zounds> true cosmopolitans never cook their own food they just order it
14:03:46 <skram> still though, might be a fun project
14:06:04 <Zounds> We've got a big korean supermarket in glasgow for some reason
14:06:30 <Zounds> I'm not sure what the korean population is exactly but I'd have figured hong kong chinese supermarket if we were gonna have an east asian one
14:06:37 <skram> glasgow's a big city though
14:07:19 <skram> I dont know if theres any sort of asian supermarket things anywhere other than Oslo tbh
14:07:59 <Zounds> I think the supermarket does stock all kinds of east asian stuff though not just korean
14:08:06 <Zounds> I've only been in a few times
14:08:30 <Zounds> It's full of desserts that look delicious but taste bad
14:08:40 <Zounds> and stinky food that tastes kinda good
14:08:43 <skram> haha
14:09:05 <skram> whats that fruit thing they eat in asia that is The Worst Smelling Thing
14:09:23 <Zounds> durians
14:09:40 <Zounds> It's the red bean paste that gets me
14:09:51 <Zounds> I don't like it at all but it does make good looking food

22:16:40 <DuB`> 4:30, not bad
22:16:56 <DuB`> 11pm to 6am
22:17:39 <Camail> dub just because pot is legal in some states you might fly over it doesn't mean you can smoke on the plane
22:17:50 <Camail> dont go to jail
22:18:58 <Dot`> and dub, join PoE  when new league starts
22:19:06 <Dot`> its like D3 but better
22:19:07 <DuB`> hmmmm
22:19:20 <Dot`> this next weekend
22:19:24 <DuB`> When dis? I could give poe one more try
22:19:33 <DuB`> Still gotta finish my d3 season journey! :P
22:19:46 <Dot`> 8th
22:20:04 <Dot`> will have to take a break to dnd i guess, as i already said i would run a game then
22:20:16 <Dot`> but otherwise im free the whole weekend
22:31:23 <Dot`> cam, I got a dub to join us
22:31:56 <Camail> neat
22:32:10 <Camail> DuB`  i think i have an interesting and interactive build for you
22:33:50 <Dot`> look at this cam here, a build dealer
22:34:32 <Camail> gotta do what i gotta do
22:34:42 <Camail> also to prove a point that poe is really good
22:36:23 <DuB`> Anything more fun than "walk 10 feet and place totem, wait 1 second. Repeat forever" would be appreciated indeed
22:37:18 <Dot`> dub, who would play a totem build?
22:37:24 <Dot`> sounds silly
22:37:39 <Dot`> thats like walking 10 feet and placing a bubble
22:37:48 <Dot`> or walking 10 feet and casting a beam
22:37:57 <Camail> dub totem builds are boring as hell
22:38:45 <Camail> i didn't realize that was your experience with builds
22:43:07 <Camail> http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2467255
22:43:31 <Dot`> is this a super speedy build
22:43:33 <Dot`> ZOOOOM
22:47:41 <Camail> it's not as fast was my trickster WO, but it is relatively fast
22:48:54 <Camail> there are some videos
22:49:27 <Camail> the primary mechanic is that orb of storms does additional attacks if you do a lightning spell in its area of effect
22:50:09 <Camail> so you have to position the oos and then yourself, and also have a really fast lightning spell to proc oos
22:52:38 <DuB`> Well I'll be back on thurs of fri
22:53:23 <Camail> we wont be playing until friday at the earliest
22:53:37 <Camail> i might make a character for league start but it wont be my main
22:54:16 <Camail> i'm building a chieftain tectonic slam build, i suggested it to skram but i think he'll enjoy rageboi berserker more
22:54:37 <Camail> Dot`  https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2452117 this is the curse build i ran and really enjoyed
22:55:19 <Camail> you can 3 of the curses around without affecting your damage much, so you can be a sort of support whenever you want
22:55:27 <Camail> you can swap*
22:56:14 <Camail> but also kill stuff
22:56:20 <Camail> (which is important)
22:57:30 <Dot`> killing stuff is nice i guess
23:14:50 <Camail> bah, did more research and my build doesn't quite work
