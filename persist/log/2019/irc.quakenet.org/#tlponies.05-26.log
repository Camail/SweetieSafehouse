22:23:26 <Runbunny> Suwako for the memes. Such a good frog.
22:32:06 <Camail> curse builds are fun, runbun
22:32:30 <Camail> bane was fun to try out
22:32:35 <Camail> dunno what i want to do for legion
22:32:59 <Runbunny> I am gonna do bane for legion.
22:33:03 <Camail> worb is still so good, and i havent done elementalist
22:33:08 <Runbunny> Or rather that was my plan.
22:33:34 <Camail> i enjoyed it
22:33:49 <Runbunny> You could try a cold DoT build. 
22:34:01 <Runbunny> That was pretty strong in betrayal.
22:34:07 <Camail> nah, i don't want to do a dot build again
22:34:24 <Dot`> may i take offence?
22:34:32 <Camail> it was fun to figure out how to play around it but things don't die quite as fast as i want them to
22:34:40 <Camail> no, you may not
22:35:56 <Camail> doing a CI build looks fun, but expensive
22:37:38 <Runbunny> You could do a melee build, with the melee rework in legion.
22:38:15 <Camail> i am interested in that, yea
22:38:21 <Camail> i also am a big fan of shield charge
22:38:40 <Camail> but movement skills are getting reworked

22:44:43 <Camail> yea, not atm cuz sf5 ended
22:44:50 <Camail> and dbfz is boring
22:46:06 <Runbunny> I have been watching a bit of tekken and I caught the end of Guilty gear.
22:49:03 <Camail> if i could do a 0 fucks given beefy tank cyclone build, that'd be nice
22:50:46 <Camail> but it depends on how armor is changed, really
22:52:10 <Runbunny> They change armor as well?
23:00:28 <Zounds> nn pon
23:17:54 <Camail> i heard that armor is getting a rework
23:18:09 <Camail> if it's gonna be a relevant state it seems like it needs one
23:18:27 <Camail> evasion and ES are literally all that matter, as far as i can tell
23:21:36 <Dot`> rude
23:39:01 <skrm> what a bitch, dot

23:46:54 <Dot`> great
23:47:27 <skrm> Theres a whole person who's job is to yell at people to wear their PPE this year
23:47:44 <skrm> career goals tbh
23:47:54 <skrm> i love yelling
23:48:01 <Dot`> you should appky for that
23:48:40 <Dot`> i want to hear norwegion shouting, it must be adorable
23:49:52 <skrm> how dare you
23:50:14 <Camail> probably squeaky 
23:50:23 <Camail> with some yipping for punctuation
23:51:03 <Dot`> i just imagine its very simler to swedish chef
23:53:46 <Camail> they are basically the same people
