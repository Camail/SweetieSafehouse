00:30:55 <Camail> RIP skrma, he was an okay dude
00:30:59 <Camail> well, he was tolerable
00:31:09 <Zounds> was he though
00:31:10 <Camail> well, he was.
00:41:21 <Dot`> i knew a skram once
00:43:03 <skrma> DuB`: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYKU26Pt_HI&t=234s
00:43:20 <skrma> 3 fuckin' crits and im still not dead
00:43:30 <skrma> ill see you in hell, DM DoT
00:52:06 <Dot`> i did get a good number of crits tonight
00:52:26 <Dot`> the whole thing was pretty screwed from the start though
00:52:42 <skrma> yeah no kiddin
00:55:13 <Camail> skram there was a hiccup in the road plan
00:55:21 <Camail> you cant build ramps diagonally
00:55:29 <Camail> so i had to make...large changes
00:55:32 <Camail> that are not done yet
00:55:47 <skrma> i believe in you buddy
00:56:12 <Camail> no time to build, it's horde night
00:57:17 <Camail> gonna save this one for when we have all 3 of us

01:00:18 <Micen|droid> Sorry DuB` windows update
01:11:20 <skrma> im down for it tomorro cam
01:31:00 <Crisium> what is a skram
01:31:12 <skrma> a miserable pile of friendship

01:52:18 <Camail> skram i made around 400 7.62 while i was prepping, which isn't as much as i'd have liked, but i got obsessed with the road and didn't do anything the else for 3 days
01:52:35 <Camail> but we dont have to use as much ammo with this set up
01:52:43 <skrma> hopefully not
01:52:49 <Camail> you can also bring over your turret
01:52:58 <Camail> i am gonna have junk ammo in the chest near the generator
01:53:04 <skrma> its alright though, i only used about 500 rounds last time
01:53:36 <Camail> i dont have enough junk ammo to last the night but i ran out of iron and time
01:53:47 <Camail> we have like 100k stone tho
01:53:51 <Camail> so we could throw that
01:54:05 <skrma> make a sea of gas and light it on fire
01:54:12 <Camail> that too
01:55:00 <Camail> after the road, i need to finish the bridge, then reinforce the base
01:55:06 <Camail> then the long hole through the mountain
01:55:16 <Camail> which is very doable with my current digging strats
01:55:22 <Camail> controlled cave-ins are great
01:55:39 <skrma> man imagine what we could do with 2 augers
01:55:43 <Camail> cut workload exponentially according to the surface area : volume ratio
01:56:00 <Camail> i could make you a lvl 5 one
01:56:16 <Camail> dunno if we have the parts
01:56:31 <Camail> motor parts are a bitch to get
01:56:42 <skrma> could do a car svac run
01:56:46 <skrma> scav
01:57:36 <Camail> do they drop from cars?
01:57:48 <skrma> yep
01:58:19 <skrma> oh right, motor tool parts
01:58:19 <Camail> then yea, that'd be worth it
01:58:20 <skrma> then no
01:58:24 <Camail> ah, yep
01:58:42 <Camail> pretty much just gotta fined low level tools or buy them from traders
01:58:48 <skrma> yeah
01:58:52 <skrma> scrappin chainsaws
01:58:52 <Camail> can do that after horde night
