01:02:58 <Camail> Runbunny gems are out
01:03:04 <Runbunny> Hello.
01:03:18 <Runbunny> Anything spicy?
01:04:23 <Runbunny> Arrow nova looks kinda fun.
01:08:34 <Runbunny> I am learning towards a bow build or a winter orb build currently.
01:20:57 <Camail> winter orb is pretty meh unless you have god tier gear
01:21:12 <Camail> literally half the clear speed it used to have
01:21:58 <Camail> I'm really hoping EA mines are gonna be good
01:22:03 <Camail> it feels really strong
01:28:40 <Runbunny> Well.
01:28:48 <Runbunny> Arrow nova maybe?
01:47:12 <Camail> well, we have different criteria for what we want to play so it's hard for me to say
