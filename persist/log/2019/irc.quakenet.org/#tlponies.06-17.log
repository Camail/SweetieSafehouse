17:50:25 <Camail> hmmm
17:50:47 <DoT`> canes asking me questions that require me to know more than , move and right click
17:51:02 <Camail> if you plan on eventually going CI energy shield is more important
17:51:09 <Camail> but it depends on the item
17:51:17 <Camail> is it jewelry, or an armor piece
17:51:31 <reification> dot https://twitter.com/klara_sjo/status/1139950298108219392
17:51:32 <Camail> and if the armor a high enough ES to warrant giving up hybrid ehp
17:51:33 <DoT`> amulet, i currently have one that adds 9% ES
17:51:44 <Camail> does it do anything else
17:51:52 <DoT`> but not really anything else i just had it for attributes earlier on and still have it
17:52:09 <Camail> does the new one give you something other than health?
17:52:54 <DoT`> cane has one with 29 lightning and 33 fire resistand +52 life
17:53:25 <Camail> you should use that, i assume your resistances aren't capped
17:53:39 <DoT`> nah, lightning is it 54
17:54:02 <Camail> you can do that, and maybe roll lightning on some fire resist you crafted onto something else
17:54:18 <Camail> also spending chaos to craft tier 3 mods on your items isn't advised
17:54:35 <Camail> you'll be replacing it all slowly, you save the strong crafts for more permanent items
17:55:37 <Cane> Camail, my build is OP.
17:55:49 <Cane> I got most of my gear and suddenly I'm death incarnate on red maps.
17:55:59 <reification> bio meem https://twitter.com/SilverVVulpes/status/1140155647507468289
17:56:15 <Cane> I forgot how miserable trying to find all the trials could be though.
17:56:20 <Cane> Like, yep, that's one of the five I already have.
17:56:39 <Cane> Camail, which maps would you recommend shaping btw?
17:58:27 <Camail> i haven't been shaping any atm, haven't felt like looking it up
17:58:40 <Camail> the only strategy i've ever followed is for elder orb
17:58:54 <Camail> but there are lists on the internet about what to shape, for various reasons
17:59:05 <Camail> some maps have good div cards, other good density
17:59:50 <Camail> and yea i'm on that 6th trial grind too
18:00:21 <Camail> i got lucky in synth, hit it pretty bad in flashback, but getting to t12 without uber lab is butts
18:00:27 <Camail> which trial are you missing
18:11:00 <Cane> I don't even know the name of it.
18:11:05 <Cane> The first one.
18:13:46 <Camail> piercing truth? the spike trap one?
18:14:18 <Camail> i'll keep a lookout if i see it
18:15:09 <Cane> Yep that's the one.
18:15:12 <Camail> i'm missing lingering pain
18:15:12 <Cane> Which one do you need?
18:15:17 <Cane> Righto.
18:15:29 <Cane> Adding that to the Discord thing.
18:15:55 <Camail> oh also i bought my lions roar, they finally dropped in price
18:16:10 <Camail> it's a nice defensive and offensive buff
18:16:51 <Cane> How much did they drop?
18:16:54 <Cane> They were like 1 ex for a while.
18:17:35 <Camail> a few intsa sold at 50c, and i got mine for 70c
18:17:51 <Camail> which is around .5ex
18:18:00 <Camail> ex are 120c atm
18:18:20 <Cane> Yeah that's way more reasonable.
18:20:07 <Cane> Camail, have you seen any of my Discord messages?
18:20:15 <Camail> oh i dont open discord >_>
18:21:39 <Camail> i promoted you so maybe that'll work
18:24:23 <Cane> Nope, need to be leader. I can apparently donate points to the guild though?
18:25:03 <Camail> ah, want do you want it to be for, then
18:25:54 <Cane> Shared stash. I always pick up generically useful items like rings/jewels/belts that's useful for all classes.
18:25:58 <Camail> oh, there's literally only two guild things to buy
18:26:04 <Cane> lol yeah?
18:26:20 <Camail> stash tabs and guild slots
18:26:25 <Cane> Righto.
18:27:26 <Cane> There, I transferred enough to get 2 tabs.
18:27:31 <Cane> I think.
18:27:54 <Camail> ok, time to figure out how to spend them
18:28:08 <Camail> oh, i had to accept
18:28:10 <Camail> neat
18:28:41 <Cane> Yeah I dunno how you use them to buy a tab.
18:29:32 <Camail> ok
18:29:34 <Camail> they exist now
18:29:39 <Camail> gotta lleave the instance
18:31:11 <Camail> do we want to name them or just leave them as dump tabs for shareable items

18:38:28 <Cane> DoT`, I put the amulet in the guild stash so you can pick it up whenever you want.

21:15:37 <DuB`> I jus don't remember the pass, haven't played in like a year!
21:15:58 <Camail> account recovery should be automated
21:16:05 <DuB`> Yes
21:16:09 <Camail> try harder
21:16:10 <DuB`> And the webpages are broken
21:16:14 <Camail> ask really nicely

21:49:36 <skrma> DuB` I ordered myself a D.Va lego thing
21:51:48 <reification> you and your lego
21:52:36 <skrma> he said, with great jealousy in his eyes
21:54:29 <Zounds> Dva is the worst character skrma
21:54:39 <Zounds> But I suppose the mech would make good lego :(
21:56:11 <skrma> its d.va and reinhardt actually
21:56:15 <skrma> the two best characters maybe
21:57:05 <Zounds> No character can be a beautiful model / pro gamer / crack shot / mecha pilot / actress at 19 y/o and be good
21:57:49 <skrma> she's probably got mad issues
21:58:18 <Zounds> McCree is the best character
21:58:33 <Zounds> He's a two dimensional composite cowboy
21:58:49 <Zounds> but he's a cowboy so yeah
21:58:51 <skrma> the whole d.va persona is probably just her disassociating from all the shitty things that robots do
21:59:02 <skrma> i mean yeah cowboys are still cool
21:59:13 <Zounds> I don't know if McCree would make good lego though
22:00:13 <skrma> the most important attribute
22:00:15 <skrma> legobility
22:00:58 <reification> bastion seems very legoable
22:01:33 <Zounds> if you made the model reaaaaaaaaally big
22:01:36 <Zounds> then McCree could be good lego
22:01:38 <skrma> so much so that he has his own set
22:08:13 <Camail> .tell cane i looked through the blog post on what bugs they're fixing... apparently bladestorm's first hit hasn't actually been hitting. 
22:14:07 <Camail> i might be doing like half the DPS i should be doing
22:14:13 <Camail> which would explain a lot, tbh

22:37:52 <Zounds> Did you guys see this btw
22:38:10 <Zounds> It explains some things we've noticed without realising
22:38:21 <Crisium> weird
22:39:56 <Zounds> I always figured the healing + gaining armor was what making shooting her with soldier entirely pointless
22:39:59 <Zounds> which it is
22:40:02 <Zounds> but even more so
22:41:48 <carcinisation> she does seem unreasonably hard to kill when ulting
