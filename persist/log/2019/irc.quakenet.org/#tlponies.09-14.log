19:06:25 <skram> shut up bby i know it
19:06:35 <Camail> my first character was a dwarven hunter
19:07:05 <Camail> got to STV, got bored and quit, bit later made my namesake as a undead priest
19:07:25 <skram> Hell yeah buddy
19:07:40 <Camail> it was fun
19:07:48 <skram> My only character was a NIGHT ELF hunter with pink hair the ugliest possible face texture
19:08:16 <Runbunny> I got to 60, then realised that you can't do anything alone on 60. Got a bit bummed out.
19:08:23 <DuB`> I played the free-to-level-20 once but got stuck on a rock and couldn't figure out how to get unstuck so I quit
19:08:25 <Camail> i wonder what would've happened if i ever made it to end game
19:08:25 <Golly> did you dance for gold
19:08:34 <Camail> DuB`  yea i believe that
19:08:39 <skram> ya you need 40++ fuckin pals to do anything
19:08:59 <Camail> i joined a raid guild before i got 60 and promised to get to 60
19:09:01 <Camail> i did not
19:09:08 <skram> no i was a boy so no erotic rp in goldshire for me golly
19:09:09 <skram> rude
19:09:20 <Runbunny> I applied for a raid guild. Got declined.
19:09:40 <Camail> gotta set the bar lower
19:09:45 <skram> hardcore raiding was fun but I probably wouldnt do it again lol
19:10:03 <Runbunny> This was only semi hardcore.
19:10:04 <DoT`> did skram reject you from his giuld runbun?
19:10:08 <DoT`> where you not a dwarf?
19:10:13 <Runbunny> I am not.
19:10:17 <Runbunny> Well not right now

19:11:52 <Runbunny> Defias brotherhood.
19:11:57 <Camail> Runbunny i dropped a vaal regalia with t1 +es and t2 hybrid, annulled it twice, i could multimod it for like 700 es
19:12:11 <Runbunny> O:
19:12:14 <skram> runbun thats an rp server
19:12:18 <Camail> almost makes it worth making a CI build
19:13:00 <Camail> Runbunny  when you level up we should do some blight maps together
19:13:07 <Camail> they're patching in more rewards next week
19:13:16 <Runbunny> Oh interesting.
19:13:23 <Runbunny> Yes Jonas.
19:13:28 <Camail> i have 12 maps that i've been holding onto because the rewards are kinda ass right now
19:13:50 <Runbunny> But I played on argent dawn before I started on defias brother and it was the worst server I had ever played on.
19:14:12 <Runbunny> I am in the end part of act 7.
19:14:38 <Camail> like i said, its not gonna be patched for awhile, no rush
19:15:09 <Camail> and i started a necro, i bought unending hunger and am leveling with it because it's dumb
19:15:35 <Camail> gonna play a ice nova pledge mana guardian once skram feels like playing
19:15:51 <Camail> 10kes or BUST
