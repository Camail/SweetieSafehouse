00:00:35 <skram> i dont think there are any social lubricant drugs that arent painfully obvious and very obnoxious to everyone
00:01:41 <Zounds> depends on the crowd
00:01:51 <Zounds> I'm not a druggie myself but I've seen a lot of them in use
00:01:55 <skram> well if everyone's fucked up its fine
00:02:06 <skram> wouldnt do coke at a wedding though
00:02:21 <Zounds> wouldn't be the worst choice tbh
00:02:55 <skram> Then you'd just turn into that guy who did coke at a wedding and ruined the atmosphere :P
00:03:20 <Zounds> you'd have to hit that sweet spot of already being a coke user
00:03:23 <Zounds> hard to do in a day
00:03:40 <skram> true
00:03:47 <skram> hey Dot whats your cocaine proficiency at
00:05:07 <Zounds> heroin is good until you end up slumped against a wall
00:05:59 <Dot> pretty low, i put points in sarcasm instead
00:06:05 <Zounds> also a national pastime here so we're all familiar with it
00:06:24 <skram> no time to level it up then
00:06:57 <skram> not a lot of smack user out here in hillbilly country but we've got alcoholism and country music
00:07:39 <Dot> skram, im still a bit confused that you thought i was getting married
00:09:44 <skram> it was a jest

00:20:40 <skram> legendary isekai boy
00:20:56 <Micen> japan wrestling is insane 
00:21:25 <Micen> watching those two anime characters fighting eachother. And they are normally a tag team
00:21:49 <Micen> "brothers" that have to fight to advance in a tournament. How much more anime can you get
00:22:50 <skram> zounds you made me look in my COOL GUYZ folder which is all tastefully edited pictures of my elf hunter from 2005
00:23:03 <Zounds> CockRoach|42: I was just looking at those doggos
00:23:07 <Zounds> ^^
00:23:14 <skram> wrestling is kinda anime in general micen
00:23:17 <skram> just look at the undertaker
00:23:41 <Micen> i know. Undertaker is an outlier in American wrestling
00:23:48 <skram> zounds https://i.imgur.com/WZlHKTo.jpg
00:24:14 <Micen> When i need to describe how magical wrestling can be i use this .
00:24:14 <Micen> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBtGFaa0idY
00:24:16 <skram> look at this guy on his non-epic cat mount despite being level 60 in a top 50 raiding guild
00:24:58 <Micen> I was sad, i dndt get my epic riding until BC on my namesake mage.
00:25:03 <CockRoach|42> Zounds: :D
00:25:16 <Zounds> very cool skram
00:25:22 <skram> account sharing was a thing back then
00:25:58 <skram> and i made friends with a spoiled kid from oslo who bought gold and upgraded my mount because it was too slow for him
00:26:02 <Micen> and my brother bought me the gold for my normal mount as a birthday present 
00:26:27 <Zounds> WoW was not my first MMO so I was a god for a while
00:26:43 <Zounds> I had all the knowledge
00:26:46 <Micen> what did you play before?
00:26:54 <Zounds> Star Wars: Galaxies
00:27:03 <Micen> Ahh. I was an EQ nerd before. 
00:27:16 <Micen> Have you all heard about Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen?
00:27:34 <skram> I got adopted by some dutch guys
00:27:36 <Zounds> I know of it
00:27:52 <Micen> Brad McQuaid led old school mmo. im kind of hypeb 
00:27:56 <Micen> if it ever comes out
00:27:58 <Zounds> I got adopted by swedes skram
00:28:08 <Zounds> sympathy please some of them are my best friends to this day
00:28:25 <skram> rip
00:28:53 <Micen> I got adopted by Canadians who took huge bong rips while on vent before every boss pull in MC
00:29:04 <Zounds> sounds about right
00:29:13 <Micen> bragging about how they can smoke
00:29:27 <Micen> and here we are some fourteen years later and i still cant legally smoke. 
00:29:53 <Micen> but i can drive north an hour. 
00:29:56 <Micen> and do so. 
00:30:00 <Micen> if i drove
00:30:12 <Zounds> there's your motivation right there
00:30:25 <Zounds> the siren call of mary jane
00:31:25 <DuB`> Anyone else watching the csgoes?

00:36:10 <Zounds> how the heck did you know of that
00:37:22 <Zounds> I worked that event lol
00:37:36 <skram> hahah
00:37:44 <Zounds> back when I did security just part time
00:37:57 <skram> the intro music is magnificent
00:38:14 <Zounds> so fuckin' surreal you'd link that
00:43:04 <Dot> Hey Cawail
00:44:45 <Micen> because i am a fan of wrestling zounds
00:45:06 <Zounds> evidently
00:45:11 <Micen> its a small world zounds
00:45:17 <Micen> teeny tiny
00:45:21 <skram> no lies
00:45:34 <skram> micen is a a huge freakin' wrestling nerd i bet

00:45:54 <Micen> no!
00:46:09 <Zounds> I didn't think anybody outside glasgow nevermind scotland knew insane CW
00:46:42 <Micen> Mostly im a fan of Grado and that has to be top 5 entrances in pro wrestling
00:47:23 <Micen> Shame Madonna DCMAed Grado on using the music as his entrance
00:47:38 <Zounds> Did she? awwwwwwwwwwww
00:47:45 <Micen> yep. its tragic
00:48:17 <Micen> he still does at house shows where the arena has a label license. but not on tv. 
00:48:58 <Zounds> I remember this I was up at the sounds/lights control
00:49:20 <Zounds> Was really into grado but I haven't thought about him in years
00:50:04 <Micen> in my eyes, he is the epitome of why wrestling is so damn cool. 
00:52:13 <Zounds> I've done a few wrestling events and they're always great
00:52:38 <Zounds> I'm no wrestling superfan myself but I do appreciate the spectacle
00:57:16 <Micen> My other wrestling link for non-fans has to be https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYvMOf3hsGA

01:39:36 <Zounds> or do
02:00:36 <Camail> i'm just trying to find magic cards, cross reference with a list of valuable cards, and set up a snipe-bot for certain cards
02:01:01 <Camail> it should be easy, but their api is impossibly convoluted and just...so bad

23:34:12 <Phearlock> yup
23:34:36 <DoT`> an hour till photographer, then we go to venue and wait more there
23:37:55 <Phearlock> read pony fanfiction on your phone
23:37:57 <Phearlock> that's what I do
23:38:17 <DvB`> Or Practical Guide to Evil
23:38:23 <DoT`> i weirdly didnt bring any books, i have 3 at home i need to start reading
23:39:06 <DoT`> instead im looking at a way to make a DnD monk with a dip into 3 levels of fighter battlemaster
23:40:43 <DvB`> Only if you use a polearm
23:40:47 <DvB`> Because they best
23:42:28 <DoT`> take kensai then you can pick weapons to be monk weapons but not anything with heavy or special
23:42:35 <DoT`> all reach weapons but whips are heavy
23:43:03 <DvB`> Hmpsh
23:43:24 <DoT`> yea, i looked at aarackokra monk with reach weapon would be so silly
23:44:03 <DoT`> almost as silly i guess as a non multiclass birb fighter with polearm
23:45:18 <Bio> neato i can strim switch
23:47:07 <DvB`> If only you could get more reactions
23:47:22 <DvB`> Fly 10ft over heads and oppportunity attack everything that comes in range!
23:47:31 <DvB`> poke poke poke poke 
23:48:04 <Runbunny> Sleep!
23:49:38 <skram> poking is shameful
23:49:45 <skram> monks are frontline bruisers
23:52:27 <DoT`> dub, what you need to do is beg micen to get the tunnel fighter fighting style
23:52:40 <Bio> skrim
23:52:47 <Bio> i had the perfect smesh level for u
23:52:50 <Bio> i wanted to show
23:53:00 <Phearlock> it was great skram
23:53:04 <Phearlock> I saw it
23:53:24 <DvB`> What's it, dot?
23:53:40 <DoT`> Dub, as a bonus action you can enter a defencive stance that allows you to make oppertunity attacks without using your reaction
23:53:48 <DvB`> what the
23:54:05 <DoT`> its a UA
23:54:14 <DoT`> and REALLY broken for a polearm fighter
23:54:32 <DoT`> add sentinal so when you hit someone theyier speed is reduced to 0
23:55:00 <DoT`> then re-enact 300 on your own
23:57:13 <DvB`> Just gotta hit :P
