22:55:26 <Camail> random suggestion, you rarely have to stream at 1080 because people dont full screen streams much, doing 900with 60fps makes it so your bitrate can stay the same and get better quality
22:55:40 <Camail> some people even stick with 720/60
22:55:53 <Camail> .tell runbunny how dare you
23:45:20 <skram> wew
