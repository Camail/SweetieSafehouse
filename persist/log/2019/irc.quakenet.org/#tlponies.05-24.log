16:44:42 <Runbunny> Well zounds. I mean there's a big dragon on the loose and an impeding war. There's troubles in Doma that are kinda ominous.
16:45:48 <Runbunny> The warrior of darkness thing did seem a little just thrown in there for the hell of it.
16:46:56 <Zounds> It's not
16:49:18 <Dot`> runbun, if you just played the previous 17 games it would make sense
16:50:07 <Zounds> that's not really how final fantasy works
16:50:21 <Zounds> I've barely played any of them but they are self contained although they do share themes and certain things
17:07:32 <Runbunny> Moogles are one.
