07:54:28 <Rawr|Phone> I don't know what I want to do dot
07:54:54 <DoT|Phone> this is a common problem
07:56:36 <DoT|Phone> they suggest you travel if you don't know. I don't know where they expect you to get the money though.

08:16:52 <Rawr|Phone> The problem is that most part time jobs require you to work evenings and weekends
08:17:22 <Runbunny> Get a full time job then.
08:17:38 <Rawr|Phone> I would if I could find someone to hire me
08:17:58 <Rawr|Phone> My degree is more than a year old at this point

19:07:17 <Camail> i'm doing well enough
19:07:45 <Camail> went to the city and saw a pretty decent play yesterday, was nice
19:08:08 <Camail> it was a free Shakespearian production, but was quite good
19:08:57 <Runbunny> Oh, it has been quite a while since I saw a play. I kinda want to see a concert though.
19:09:10 <Runbunny> All those violin meme videos are getting to me.
19:09:28 <Camail> hahaha, memes are making you cultured
19:10:19 <Camail> there's a restaurant in chicago that's had small philharmonic events, i went to one last year
19:11:14 <Camail> i'm sure you could find something, music performances are everywhere
19:12:15 <Runbunny> I used to play a bit of music. However the guys I played with were like way better than me. Was pretty fun though

19:13:37 <Runbunny> Hai Phearlock
19:13:47 <Runbunny> Did you just come back?
19:13:50 <Phearlock> no
19:14:03 <Phearlock> Was at work today
19:14:11 <Runbunny> Anyhoo Kerbal space program 2 was announced.
19:14:14 <Runbunny> So there is that.
19:14:15 <Phearlock> oh?
19:14:24 <Phearlock> that's potentially really cool
19:14:36 <Runbunny> Yeah, earlier tonight at gamescom.
19:15:21 <skram> is the first one even out of early access
19:15:38 <Phearlock> Yes, it had its like "official" 1.0 well over a year ago
19:15:48 <Phearlock> They still have done some DLC and content updates
19:15:57 <skram> ooh i see
19:16:10 <Phearlock> Hope 2 will be as moddable.
19:16:36 <skram> anything is moddable if you're angry enough, ferlok
19:18:21 <Camail> i wonder what a sequel for a sandbox game entails
19:18:22 <Phearlock> The cinematic trailer looks really pretty. Hope the ingame graphics are close to this.
19:18:32 <Camail> interstellar travel?
19:18:39 <Camail> maybe even meet humans
19:18:40 <Phearlock> Well the trailer started with a lot of the older familiar stuff but prettified
19:18:53 <Phearlock> Then gradually shows off a ton more like "oh I've never seen that before"

19:22:13 <Camail> good good
19:22:22 <Runbunny> I didn't swim. I was busy walking.
