17:36:05 <skram> hey pals
17:37:25 <Cane> Hiya skram. <3
17:39:06 <skram> Cane buddy, how many lil friends do you have in PoE now? Enough to make your CPU melt?
17:39:36 <Cane> So my army takes a little bit of explaining.
17:39:47 <Cane> Most of the time, I'm running around with 8. That's 2 spectres and 6 zombies.
17:39:55 <Cane> But when spectres hit anything, it summons Phantasms.
17:40:00 <Cane> And there's easily 10 of those.
17:40:13 <Cane> Then I summon skeletons to deal with rares and boss monsters, and I can summon 10 of those.
17:40:28 <Cane> Then I pop Vaal Summon Skeletons for map bosses, and that's 28 or so.
17:41:11 <Cane> If pressed, I might admit that the game occasionally frame lags a little bit.
17:41:18 <skram> haha
17:41:22 <skram> no golems?
17:41:44 <Cane> I literally have no more sockets to spend, or I'd have a golem and be spraying SRS too.
17:42:10 <Cane> I'm using a Holy Relic, although I can swap that out with a golem from time to time.
17:42:57 <Cane> If I wanted to, I could replace CWDT Spirit Offering and get a golem instead.
17:43:17 <Cane> But it's not linked so it's not the best.
17:43:27 <Cane> It's tempting though just to maximize my number.
17:43:41 <skram> I dont have enough hours in PoE to know what CWDT is an abbreviation for, cane :P
17:43:48 <Cane> Cast When Damage Taken.
17:43:53 <skram> oh right
17:43:54 <Cane> Usually used with Immortal Call and Increased duration.
17:44:01 <Cane> But I use it with Spirit Offering.
17:45:26 <Cane> Boss fights are just me popping everything and hiding behind a wall.
17:46:22 <Cane> How's yours going?
17:46:36 <skram> I did the herald of agony build last season, which is just me trying to make my scorpion more better
17:46:40 <skram> was kinda boring honestly
17:47:01 <Cane> OH RIGHT I have a Herald of Agony which I proc with ball lightning. I run around with 40 Virulence so it does a shit ton of damage.
17:47:05 <Cane> I knew I was forgetting something. =)
17:47:16 <skram> Well I got a rando 6link and cam rerolled it once into perfect colors so i'd say its going pretty well
17:47:22 <skram> feels great just spinning across maps
17:47:23 <Cane> I have so much hate.
17:47:28 <Cane> I'm still using my Tabula.
17:47:31 <Cane> I've barely found 5 links.
17:47:34 <skram> So's he. :P
17:47:58 <Cane> Yeah, we'll both just hate you for a while.
17:48:05 <Cane> What kind of 6 link was it?
17:48:50 <skram> I cant remember the names of things, but it had the right stats, hp and str and things
17:48:59 <skram> but it was corrupted and I didnt have any vaal orbs
17:50:16 <Cane> Wait, what do you mean? You can change corrupted items?
17:50:33 <skram> apparently you can reroll gem colors if you use vaal orbs
17:50:37 <Cane> Wow, okay.
17:50:43 <Cane> I hope that's new or I'm an idiot.
17:51:05 <skram> No idea :p
17:53:23 <Cane> DoT`, you alive at all?
17:53:53 <DoT`> whats up
17:54:10 <Cane> Are you in DND mode in PoE? You haven't responded to me at all. =P

17:54:41 <DoT`> i havnt seen antrgin
17:54:43 <DoT`> anything
17:54:49 <Cane> Wat.
17:55:23 <Cane> I've been messaging you. Are they really not going through?
17:55:39 <DoT`> i got nothing
17:55:44 <Cane> Oh.
17:55:51 <DoT`> i have global and trade chat off
17:55:53 <Cane> Do you have whispers turned off in the chat window? Is it grayed out?
17:55:54 <Cane> Hmm.

20:48:03 <skram> africans with ~normal~ names freak their bean apparently
20:48:04 <DoT`> well to start with africa isnt real
20:48:20 <skram> if africa isnt real how can i bless the rains
20:48:27 <Zounds> You should go to the usa and antagonize "african" americans DoT`
20:48:32 <Zounds> Since you're the real deal
20:48:36 <DoT`> HAHA
20:48:47 <DoT`> i may get shot zounds
20:49:05 <Zounds> That's a risk I'm willing you to take
20:49:07 <skram> you're just gonna get suffocated in mean girls references
20:49:46 <DoT`> skram, you should just add a click into my name
20:50:26 <skram> i dont know how
20:50:37 <Runbunny> Skr!am
20:50:48 <skram> move to denmark and you can be
20:50:50 <skram> afrodansker
20:51:06 <Runbunny> No one says this.
20:51:19 <Zounds> Africans in glasgow tend to be a bit more specific about their heritage
20:51:26 <DoT`> i dont understand, pls explain runbun
20:51:27 <Zounds> Since they know where they came from typically
20:51:52 <Runbunny> also "dansker" implies a white dude, so it's cultural appropiation.
20:52:01 <DoT`> zounds never trust someone who claims to have south african heritage
20:52:26 <Zounds> Mostly nigerians I meet DoT`
20:52:30 <Zounds> lots of them in security
20:52:32 <DoT`> though im guessing you mean they say Zulu, Xhosa, 
20:52:43 <DoT`> nigerians, yea, all drug dealers
20:52:50 <skram> or royalty
20:52:50 <Runbunny> O:
20:53:13 <Zounds> The guys I know are pretty good dudes I don't think they deal drugs D:
20:53:24 <DoT`> its all part of the cover
20:55:18 <reification> the igbo tend to be very successful
21:05:34 <Zounds> http://is2.4chan.org/v/1560718685053.webm oh dear
