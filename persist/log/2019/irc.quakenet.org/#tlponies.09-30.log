18:01:03 <Dot`> D:
18:01:09 <Dot`> betrayed by pizza?
18:02:33 <skram> yes :(
18:06:10 <Dot`> a most deep and tragic thing
18:06:27 <skram> i dont know who to trust anymore
18:08:47 <Dot`> you have to keep yourself open skram even if it means risking such pain
18:09:22 <Dot`> oh, its payday
18:09:34 <skram> hell yeah brother
18:09:52 <Dot`> time to hoard
18:10:24 <skram> nono
18:10:26 <skram> spend it all
18:10:29 <skram> on things you dont need

18:52:46 <skram> bjørn do you wanna have a golem playdate
19:01:10 <skram> lel
19:01:29 <skram> Camail, after 10 minutes of playtime after like 1 week of not playing i got an ex
19:02:11 <Camail> good good
19:02:17 <Camail> make th emoney
19:03:49 <Camail> ex are so damn expensive this league
19:06:13 <skram> hmm
19:06:27 <skram> im not sure what to get to improve this build
19:06:33 <skram> could get a 6link i guess
19:06:38 <skram> or some better jewelry
19:06:50 <Camail> 6link is always a good upgrade
19:07:04 <Camail> cuz support gems are More damage, which means a multiplier
19:07:40 <Camail> also if you're going golem and need those jewels
19:07:45 <Camail> also getting better rares

19:08:43 <Camail> the first thing would be a decent 6link, maybe a corrupt hybrid that would be easier to change colors
19:09:02 <Camail> or a good base
19:09:15 <Camail> then you craft it with essence of greed
19:34:47 <Camail> skram you need to tell me what trials you need
19:35:28 <skram> so forceful
19:35:34 <skram> well lemme check
19:36:41 <skram> got stinging, lingering, and crippeling done
19:37:10 <skram> so need piercing, swirling, stinging
19:37:55 <Camail> you said stinging twice
19:38:16 <skram> roght
19:38:17 <Camail> remembering the second word is easier
19:38:33 <skram> piercing, swirling, burning

20:00:35 <skram> just got piercing truth dropped Camail
20:00:48 <Camail> nice
20:02:41 <Camail> according to the challenge tracker i've spent 440k sulphite
20:04:20 <skram> thats a lot of delving dude
20:05:12 <Camail> a lot of it was for xp farming
20:05:29 <Camail> but the new master system made it pretty easy to get that much
20:05:44 <Camail> ~5k per map
20:09:06 <Dot`> also still no empower gems yet cam
20:09:14 <Camail> well yea
20:09:21 <Camail> thats hella end game
20:09:45 <Camail> dont even think about those
20:11:13 <Dot`> yea, they expensive
20:11:46 <Camail> lvl 3 corrupted ones are cheaper
20:11:58 <Camail> lvl 4 are irrelevantly expensive
20:12:44 <Camail> and in order to level your own up to 3 you'd need to play like 15 times as much as you have ever played
20:13:35 <Camail> getting a unique gem to level 2 is like getting a normal gem to 20
20:13:42 <Camail> then 10 times that to level 3
20:13:59 <Dot`> thats a lot of playing
20:15:06 <Camail> yea the upper limit on grinding is very high
20:15:12 <Camail> i will never grind that hard
20:21:38 <Camail> there's kinda 3 degrees of playing hard that can be summed up based on your character level: 95,98, and 100
20:22:00 <Camail> 95 = you play a lot but aren't actually grinding anything in particular

20:35:11 <Dot`> ive had 1 lvl 7 map and about 3 lvl 6
20:35:26 <Dot`> usualy stuck around lvl 2 maps, i feel im really doing sometihng wrong
20:36:00 <Dot`> im making lvl 1-5 magic
20:36:38 <Dot`> and there are still some lvl 2,3 and 4 i havnt found yet
20:36:45 <Dot`> but i have like 20 alleyways
20:40:07 <skrma> Dot` https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqSclLcbvCA
20:41:09 <Dot`> why have a heard this before
20:41:24 <Dot`> probably runbun
20:41:27 <skrma> this is a cultural icon, pal
20:44:20 <Dot`> oh right, now i recognise it, the official version
20:50:17 <Camail> you might not be doing maps efficiently dot
20:50:27 <Camail> just gogogo, run through them as fast as possible
20:50:37 <Camail> alleyways is a great map to clear
20:50:37 <Dot`> Its liek some weird russian mix of Die antwoord and lonley island skram
20:50:47 <skrma> my favorites
20:51:10 <Dot`> i cant cam, im slow, no real killing power yet with onyl 4 golems
20:51:16 <Dot`> does going faster get you better stufF?
20:51:27 <skrma> how do you map efficiently with minions anyway cam
20:51:56 <skrma> even with leap slam and convocation it seems kinda clunky
20:52:04 <Camail> using convocation and running fast
20:52:07 <Camail> the first teleports them to you
20:52:17 <Camail> the second makes them telpor to you after they are a certain distance away
20:52:54 <Camail> thats all you can do
20:53:04 <Camail> minions builds dont have as fast a clear speed as self cast builds
20:53:31 <Dot`> but also items are left behind as if you do mage to go fast stuff does behind, often off screen, so you dont see the items
20:53:36 <Camail> try not waiting for things to die
20:53:42 <Camail> run passed them and let minions kill them
20:53:57 <Camail> most items aren't worth picking up
20:54:08 <Camail> worthwhile items will appear on the mini map
20:54:16 <Camail> and also make a sound
21:01:52 <skrma> i really need things with better resists
21:01:56 <skrma> im not even capped
21:07:23 <Camail> did you check the storage
21:07:28 <Camail> i've put gut rings in there

21:17:49 <Camail> hmmm, you should be able to do temples, especially with primal might
21:17:53 <Camail> alva is the map lady
21:17:57 <Camail> where you get to do an extra map
21:18:30 <Camail> dont even worry about her quest at th emoment
21:18:42 <Camail> moving around elder influence can be tedious
21:19:38 <Dot`> i need to do alvl 7 map next if i recall 
21:19:51 <Dot`> and i have yet to find one
21:21:14 <Camail> eh, it's gonna happen
21:21:54 <Camail> i takes the best palyers multiple day in ssf to set up their atlas
21:22:03 <Camail> its just gonna take a long time for someone new
21:22:13 <Camail> thats the end game tho
21:22:24 <Camail> completing your atlas, going through zana's story
21:22:29 <Camail> oh i keep saying alva
21:22:35 <Camail> ugh i always get their names wrong
21:22:55 <Camail> zana is map lady, and her quest is like, the driving force behind playing most of the game
21:26:31 <Camail> you got really lucky on trials tho
21:26:44 <Camail> last league i was level 92 doing t13s before i got my last trial
21:27:42 <skrma> i only had 3 finished all last season and i ended up at level 93 i think
