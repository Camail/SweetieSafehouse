02:58:16 <Camail> Runbunny  dub is deep in the monhun mines
03:02:12 <Runbunny> How deep?
03:03:04 <Runbunny> I should get some of the stuff done before ice borne as well.
03:03:14 <Runbunny> like 100 hunter rank quest.,
03:03:24 <Camail> end of november is another festival
03:04:17 <Runbunny> I should also take an hour and just get rid of all the random weapons that I am never gonna use
03:04:56 <Camail> meh
03:05:06 <Runbunny> Is the next festival the winter one?
03:05:11 <Camail> having weapon loadouts makes inventory management pretty moot
03:05:14 <Camail> no idea
03:05:19 <Camail> i was just looking at the schedule
03:05:31 <Camail> and events come back Nov 28th
03:06:26 <Runbunny> Hmm.
03:06:54 <Camail> we can do some atkt then, too

04:20:43 <Camail> RIP
04:20:51 <Camail> so electric fenses are quite good
04:20:56 <Camail> fences*
04:31:07 <DuB`> Do you have to hook them up to one of those generator banks somehow?
04:33:50 <Camail> yea you wire em up
04:34:15 <Camail> i kinda panic designed it so the battery placement is bad
04:34:22 <Camail> but its gonna be fine later
04:36:09 <Camail> made it through the night and they didnt even get to the stairs
04:36:35 <DuB`> hah
04:39:26 <Camail> oh also bikes have storage
04:39:41 <Camail> each vehicle has incrementally larger storage
04:39:46 <Camail> did not know that

17:13:57 <skram> doesnt say when but wasteland 2 was really good
17:14:05 <Camail> hmm, never played
17:14:10 <Camail> i'll look at it
17:14:57 <skram> its isometric squad-based post nuclear war rpg
17:15:09 <skram> so basically fallout 1/2 but with better textures
17:19:52 <Golly> its a good one 4sur
17:21:38 <Golly> it was kinda weird how it just ditched a game mechanic in the 2nd half with the needing water thing
17:21:52 <Golly> then you suddenly dont anymore, but the game doesnt explain it
17:23:03 <Golly> it also does another interesting choice mechanic early on, that doesnt really happen in the same way later

22:06:06 <Camail> ur all dumb
22:06:17 <Camail> blastoise is objectively the best start
22:06:22 <Camail> articuno is the best legendary
22:06:29 <Camail> and digimon is better than pokemon
22:06:38 <Camail> these are TRUTHS
22:07:02 <Dot`> i thin kcam is having a stroke
22:07:08 <Dot`> all his typing is weird
22:08:31 <Camail> every legendary younger than gen 3 looks the same!
22:08:36 <Camail> digimon has anime tiddy
22:08:42 <Camail> clearly the better franchise
22:14:26 <Dot`> i agree with articuno  being best legendary
