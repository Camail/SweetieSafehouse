08:35:57 <Camail> Runbunny i did deathless uber elder woooo
08:36:03 <Runbunny> Hai
08:36:05 <Runbunny> Nice.
08:36:17 <Camail> i got down to a few thousand ES 
08:36:25 <Camail> so every toher build i played would have died a few times
08:36:27 <Runbunny> My fan problem is causing me trouble
08:36:38 <Camail> hm, not enoguh fans?
08:36:41 <Camail> or broken 
08:36:52 <Runbunny> Nah it's one fan, that's making a lot of noise.
08:37:03 <Runbunny> I think it's because it's spinning too slowly.
08:37:09 <Camail> bleh, off balance blades maybe?
08:37:24 <Camail> did you check for damage
08:37:43 <Camail> you can force fan speed in the BIOS
08:38:04 <Runbunny> usually I can reboot a few times and it goes away
08:38:24 <Runbunny> but I can also just manually touch the fan and it goes away.
08:39:09 <Camail> did you lube it up
08:39:19 <Runbunny> I tried downloading speed fan, but it doesn't show any of my fans.
08:39:31 <Camail> slather it with honey
08:39:38 <Runbunny> and BIOS options didn't do anything either.
08:39:57 <Runbunny> I think my motherboard just doesn't know the fans exists.
08:40:07 <Runbunny> I could punch it.
08:40:15 <Camail> do fans have drivers?
08:40:26 <Camail> i dont thiiiink so
08:40:49 <Camail> maybe, but anyone
08:41:07 <Camail> i am tired as balls, just came in here to tell someone because my brother is asleep and i cant bug him
08:41:10 <Camail> zzzzzzz
08:41:16 <Camail> enjoy your day runbun
08:41:17 <Runbunny> :D
