00:08:44 <Runbunny> Yes.
00:09:04 <Runbunny> It seems rather simple, for the most part, unless I am missing something.

20:29:47 <Zounds> how fareth thee and thine skram my friend
20:30:05 <skram> I made lemonade
20:30:20 <skram> I dont know why its not really a thing here in scandiland because its friggin delicious
20:31:11 <Zounds> be the trendsetter
20:31:11 <DuB`> Not a thing! Kinda surprising
20:31:23 <Zounds> deliver your people from their lack of lemonade
20:31:27 <skram> :D
20:32:35 <Golly> this is saft country skram
20:32:39 <skram> Well I suppose historically speaking its because citrus fruits dont really live up here and we got our sweet drinks from squash instead
20:32:43 <skram> yeh
20:33:02 <skram> all about dat sun berry saf
20:33:16 <skram> though i suppose way over in the west you lot do weird things to apples instead
20:35:39 <Golly> is there any other word than kool aid to explain it
20:36:07 <Golly> youd think there would be a word
20:36:26 <skram> they call it squash in the uk
20:36:41 <Zounds> \o/
20:36:53 <Golly> ironically lemonade is the only word i can think of thats close
20:37:15 <skram> Its where you reduce berries/fruit to a syrup and mix it with water when you wanna drink it, zounds?
20:37:32 <skram> you also do that with lemonade sorta
20:37:48 <Zounds> yes skrammen
20:38:45 <Zounds> also called a cordial or concentrate
