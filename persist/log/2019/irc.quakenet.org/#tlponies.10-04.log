01:11:28 <Camail> DuB` why is your computer dumb
01:13:20 <DuB`> That took 30 minutes
01:13:29 <DuB`> The sudden work took 45
01:13:32 <skrma> hey cam which are the boys that i wanna specterize again
01:13:32 <Camail> you done working
01:13:34 <DuB`> zzz
01:13:35 <DuB`> Ya
01:14:04 <Camail> i dunno skram, it seems your build wants to have buffs from spectres
01:14:09 <Camail> imo you dont want to use them
01:14:45 <Camail> its a waste of a socket if you aren't scaling spectres
01:14:48 <skrma> but i love my lil buddies
01:14:52 <Camail> either 4link them or dont use them
01:15:07 <skrma> they are 4linkd
01:15:10 <Camail> but if you want to 4link them go for slave drivers from act 6 control blocks
01:15:22 <Camail> but you also need to get a fuckin active skill
01:15:46 <Camail> just get stormbrand + curse on hit + vulnerability
01:16:12 <skrma> flesh offering is an active skill!
01:16:37 <Camail> no
