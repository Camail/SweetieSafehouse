16:24:12 <skram> camail how do i find fractured walls
16:24:32 <Camail> ummm, well they're on the minimap
16:24:45 <Camail> and generally, any path your cart doesnt take is an area that can potentially have a wall
16:24:56 <Camail> so you have to travel through the darkness
16:25:04 <Camail> walls are typically fairly close to the path
16:25:15 <Camail> the exception is walls that hide pathways to nodes
16:25:23 <Camail> they can be pretty deep

22:49:15 <skram> again
22:49:34 <Camail> yes, it's the one i need to do uber lab on
22:49:48 <Camail> but like...i don't know where i am gonna get my damage
22:49:55 <Camail> i need so much more crit chance
22:52:18 <skram> what you got going this time
22:53:49 <Camail> its a dex stacking void fletcher scourge arrow raider
22:54:24 <skram> thats a lot of things
22:54:36 <Camail> i get most of my flat damage from the shaper mod on my bow that says "add cold damage per 10 dexterity"
22:54:48 <Camail> so you stack an ass ton of dex
22:58:47 <Camail> i still need to get 2 build enabling uniques, but i'm up to 1mil dps
22:58:57 <Camail> it needs to be waaay higher to be relevant
22:59:11 <Camail> the only reason this character survives is because it instantly kills anything
