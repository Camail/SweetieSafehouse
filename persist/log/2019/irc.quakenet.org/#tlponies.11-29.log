15:01:40 <DuB`> And got the best HBG in the game from Kulve first run last night :O 
15:01:57 <Rawr|Fone> Pretty great dub
15:02:01 <skrm> xivo jima is our favorite fight isnt it
15:02:03 <Rawr|Fone> How are you today
15:02:10 <Rawr|Fone> Jonas my dear
15:02:42 <DuB`> AT Xeno is absolutely the hardest fight I've done

15:03:05 <DuB`> wow
15:03:36 <skrm> my teeth hurt, henrik
15:03:48 <Dot`> oh boy
15:03:52 <Dot`> the skramdub
15:03:55 <Dot`> what a great combo
15:04:44 <Dot`> i looked at a new apartment today skram
15:04:52 <Dot`> it was smaller than mine, but GROUND FLOOR
15:04:54 <Dot`> and cheaper
15:05:14 <skrm> do we want to live in the ground floor?
15:05:28 <Dot`> yea, stairs are the worst
15:05:34 <Rawr|Fone> Why do they hurt jonas
15:05:43 <Runbunny> Have you done the other AT elder dragons Dub?
15:05:50 <DuB`> As long as there's no flooding in skeletonthorpe
15:05:54 <skrm> because a dentist put nails into my jaw or something
15:05:59 <DuB`> Ya Runbunny
15:06:05 <Runbunny> Dang.
15:06:08 <Dot`> skram, the mouth is not meant for metal
15:06:09 <Runbunny> I am failing behind.
15:06:46 <Rawr|Fone> That does not sound good skrammypants
15:07:01 <DuB`> Xeno is the only one I haven't managed to solo. Had to go to MHW discord and get a carry group and just play safe while supporting :P
15:07:08 <DuB`> ... and had to do that 4 times
15:07:27 <DuB`> skrm why nails in face???
15:07:42 <Runbunny> Are you okay Jonas?
15:08:02 <skrm> I had a root canal and my dentist had nails
15:08:08 <skrm> he didnt explain what he did
15:08:17 <DuB`> T_T
15:08:49 <Dot`> have you been eating too many sweets and not brushing properly?
15:08:53 <Dot`> Jonas pls
15:08:57 <Dot`> no pain
15:09:03 <skrm> pfft no way

15:11:09 <Runbunny> So you're all fixed now Jonas?
15:11:13 <Runbunny> Great.
15:12:27 <skrm> I sure hope so
15:12:34 <skrm> dentists are fucking expensive
15:13:30 <Runbunny> Indeed.
15:15:20 <Dot`> you should just get all your teeth extracted
15:15:24 <Dot`> then no more dentists
15:15:57 <skrm> removing a tooth is pretty expensive too
15:16:00 <skrm> let alone like 30 of em
15:16:55 <DuB`> The dentist procedure to end all dentist procedures.
15:17:10 <Runbunny> Just take them out yourself.
15:18:43 <Dot`> skram, i need someone more relaible to play escape from tarkov with
15:18:46 <Dot`> TJ keeps being at work
15:18:50 <Dot`> dumb time zones
15:20:05 <Runbunny> Dot you could go hunt Dub while you wait.
15:20:17 <DuB`> D:
15:22:33 <skrm> im not very reliable in that regard either Dot` D:
15:23:07 <skrm> oh boi i wonder what sort of swords i can make with dub parts
15:24:20 <Runbunny> You can make a scarf.
15:24:57 <Dot`> cozyiest scarf ever i bet
15:27:54 <Dot`> DOOM is only ¬£5, i have been meaning to play that
15:28:55 <Dot`> and ive been paid it seems
15:36:43 <Dot`> are you gettign some time off work skram?
15:42:03 <skrm> ya next week
15:43:08 <skrm> looks like ill be busy tho
15:44:03 <Dot`> looking at houses?
15:44:13 <skrm> dad had surgery this week but he's old and stubborn so ill probably have to finish the carpentry thing he's doing atm
15:44:32 <DuB`> Sounds like a dad
15:44:35 <skrm> doc told him no heavy lifting but he's all muh garage
15:44:49 <Dot`> haha aww
15:45:16 <Dot`> im still willing to be adopted by your dad skram
15:45:20 <Dot`> and do lifting for him
15:45:48 <skrm> ill float the idea when i see him next
15:46:40 <Dot`> thanks
15:47:02 <DuB`> But skram was going to be adopted by my mom
15:59:40 <Rawr|Phone> That doesn't mean dot can't be adopted dub
15:59:52 <Rawr|Phone> Don't ruin his dreams
16:00:00 <DuB`> Of course not
16:01:11 <Runbunny> So I am sitting in my chair and I am dying, can't even stay away. I go the 2,5 meter and lay on my bed.
16:01:21 <Runbunny> Wide awake can't nap.
16:01:26 <carcinisation> magic
16:01:36 <Runbunny> It's something at least.
16:05:29 <Dot|Phone> Runbun, solution is a comfy couch
16:13:53 <Runbunny> I don't have a couch :/
16:18:41 <skrm> DuB` its been several years but ive recieved no papers
16:18:48 <skrm> im starting to think your mum doesnt love me
16:19:03 <DuB`> Hmmm
16:19:11 <DuB`> I'll bring it up at christmastime
16:19:16 <skrm> thanks
16:20:46 <skrm> Dot|Phone you should organize a kickstarter to get runbun a couch
16:21:35 <Runbunny> No please.
16:21:48 <Runbunny> Then I have to clean up my room for it to fit.
16:22:03 <DuB`> Even better
16:22:10 <Dot`> i dont have a couch either
16:23:05 <skrm> You should get one of those tables with the blankets and the heater
16:24:21 <Runbunny> and sit on the floor?
16:24:42 <Runbunny> Like peasants?
16:25:03 <skrm> i guess
16:26:49 <Runbunny> But we have insolation in our houses. 
16:28:12 <skrm> are you sure?
16:37:14 <Golly>   Insolation' is the solar radiation that reaches the earth's surface. It is measured by the amount of solar energy received per square centimetre per minute.
16:37:27 <Golly> made me learn n stuff
16:40:28 <Golly> in other words, he can fit the while sun in there, but no couch
16:40:39 <Golly> whole even
16:41:43 <Runbunny> oh.
16:41:51 <Runbunny> It's insulation in english :/
16:41:58 <Golly> hehe yep
16:41:58 <Runbunny> G.G.
16:42:26 <DuB`> Well I assume you have some insolation too

16:58:55 <Runbunny> I am feeling pretty good right now.
16:59:18 <Runbunny> Just trying nap did wonders for me apparently.
16:59:49 <Runbunny> I should use this new found energy for video games.
17:00:09 <Runbunny> What about you friend?
17:01:59 <Zounds> im doing alright, glad it's friday
17:02:23 <Runbunny> Indeed. First friday in the week. Do you have anything special lined up?
17:03:59 <Zounds> mostly to recover from the week =P
17:04:08 <Zounds> gonna order myself a curry but that's about it
17:04:41 <Zounds> how about you my friend
17:06:03 <Runbunny> I want to get pizza actually.
17:07:33 <Runbunny> Also, there is this british lady who makes a christmas cabaret every year. This year it's called "The three Brexiteers". I kinda want to watch it.

17:23:53 <Camail> hullo bun
17:24:43 <Rawr|Phone> Good evening camail
17:24:54 <Camail> roraror
17:28:34 <skrm> cam of ail
17:28:42 <Camail> You.
17:33:44 <Rawr|Phone> Runbun you could get something that's better than pizza
17:34:52 <skrm> is it
17:35:02 <skrm> deeeeeeeZEEE NUTS??
17:35:12 <Runbunny> !!!
17:35:17 <Runbunny> Are you coming by Rawr?
17:36:16 <Rawr|Phone> Maybe another day dear
17:36:44 <Runbunny> Then pizza it is.
17:37:20 <Camail> so skram the other day i stopped playing when i was in a bad spot
17:37:51 <Camail> needless to say when i get back on again i'mma need you to bring the truck, a splint, and some med kits
17:38:25 <Camail> i beached my gyrocopter on a roof surrounded by irradiated zombies and had to jump
17:45:49 <Runbunny> Operation: Stranded Zebra.
18:07:38 <Camail> the irradiated cop spit acid on the tower made of cement and literally dissolved it as i was running away
18:07:51 <Camail> it was pretty intense having 50 zombies chasing me
18:08:00 <Dot`> haha
18:08:58 <Camail> it's in my power to walk alll the way back to base and get healed up because normal zombie spawns are basically harmless at this point
18:09:09 <Camail> but i'd rather just wait for someone to pick me up
18:17:46 <Dot`> i mean, if you can get skram to come running why not

18:49:00 <skram> I did not perish in a fiery crash today either.
18:49:06 <skram> Oh well. Theres always next time.
18:49:37 <Camail> i wont let you die that easy
18:49:40 <Camail> unless its to zombies
18:49:45 <Camail> then i will, multiple times
18:49:58 <skram> What a good friend you are eh
18:50:12 <Camail> i help those who help themselves
18:55:16 <skram> do you though
19:03:09 <Runbunny> A grand day today is it then?
19:03:14 <Camail> oh skram i didnt tell you
19:03:22 <Camail> so during horde ngiht they burrowed through the side
19:03:27 <Camail> instead of going through the death tunnel
19:03:43 <Camail> so i had to build an outerwall
19:03:44 <skram> ah shit
19:03:54 <skram> digger zombies
19:03:55 <Camail> i think the issue was that i closed the outer door to repair blocks
19:03:55 <skram> what a nightmare
19:04:02 <skram> ah
19:04:04 <skram> that'd do it
19:04:14 <Camail> the new steel block dont blow up after one demo, but they can't handle two
19:04:51 <Camail> but junk turrets would keep setting them off so i move my junk turrets and destroyed yours because neither of you had level 5s
19:05:01 <Camail> even though there were like 4 in the chests
19:05:33 <skram> chests are tricky
19:05:43 <Camail> well mine are labeled now
19:07:30 <Camail> i gotta do some christmas stuff now, but maybe play later
19:07:37 <Camail> the gyrocopter is hella fast
19:07:43 <Camail> i'll see if i can make you one too
19:10:26 <Camail> i need to make 5 more forges to get the smelting faster...
