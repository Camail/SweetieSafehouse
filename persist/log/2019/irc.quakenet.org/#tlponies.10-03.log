15:15:18 <BioPhone> Put on sweater sir dot
15:15:27 <BioPhone> Also hi
15:16:23 <BioPhone> I played a lvl 6 rooge the other day. Arcane trickster w booming blade. Did 4d8 and 3d6 dmg
15:16:42 <BioPhone> What a nutty cantrip
15:21:10 <Camail> its balanced by letting the target choose not to move next turn
15:21:28 <Camail> so it's relatively useless on non-melee enemies
15:22:57 <Dot|Phone> I need that maths explained
15:24:22 <Dot|Phone> Normal hit + 2d8 if it moves
15:26:18 <Runbunny> Camail, I am pretty good today, however all these days are just the same since I don't do a lot.
15:26:26 <Camail> sneak attack explains the extra d6
15:26:51 <Dot|Phone> And rapier for 1d8
15:27:21 <Camail> Runbunny  yup, it's just a matter of holding on to each day, gotta make it matter somehow
