21:06:59 <Camail> it keeps saying i need a patch
21:07:05 <Camail> and it keeps downloading a patch, repeat
21:07:33 <Camail> i'm gonna just bite the bullet and try uber elder, i guess
21:07:47 <Camail> even though i now know my build isn't as good for uber elder as others
21:11:05 <Runbunny> lol

21:19:43 <Camail> finally poe is ejecting the d20 from their calculations
21:19:48 <Camail> no longer capping accuracy to 95%
21:19:59 <Camail> fucking crit fails have always felt weird to me in videogames
21:20:50 <skram> its ok, i dont know how to aim anyway
21:22:05 <Camail> skram wizard is so strong in d3
21:22:08 <Camail> it's just dumb
21:22:31 <skram> wizards have been really good in every fuckin season tho
21:22:36 <skram> time 4 nerf
21:22:46 <Camail> i can do gr90 without an ancient OR gifted weapon
21:22:56 <Camail> archon is the strongest they've been
21:24:24 <skram> i miss thornsbuild crus
21:25:08 <Camail> i think last season it was meta

21:28:52 <CockRoach|42> Dot`: <3
21:30:00 <Runbunny> Looks pretty good so far.

21:30:38 <Runbunny> So ofc I am going to play chaos dot build that doesn't use melee at all.

21:37:56 <Camail> but
21:38:01 <Camail> you literally just did a melee build
21:38:07 <Camail> when it was its worst
21:38:11 <Runbunny> Ofc.
21:38:15 <Camail> runbun
21:38:18 <Camail> you dont have to be this way
21:38:24 <Runbunny> That is how you are a Tier nun.
21:38:32 <Camail> you can do things well, i know you can
21:38:46 <Camail> just, do good things
21:38:47 <Camail> pls
21:39:19 <Runbunny> To be fair, I did a super meta build in betrayal.
21:39:37 <Runbunny> well it ended up being super meta anyways.
22:02:45 <Runbunny> Camail my flashback character is stronger than my regular synthesis characters.
22:02:59 <Camail> lul
22:03:23 <Camail> well i just changed my build, removed MoM and am using hatred
22:03:41 <Camail> i have a watcher eye that gives me a bonus for Hatred
22:03:52 <Camail> so that's a nice 1.1k sheet DPS
22:04:36 <Bio> hej
22:04:36 <Runbunny> Yeah, I have a incursion belt that increases hatred by like 54%
22:04:38 <Bio> i hom
