00:13:41 <Camail> dont study the material, figure out how to make the most important parts accessible 
00:14:53 <Camail> i hate open note tests, it's more about research than understanding most of the time
00:28:44 <DuB`> ye
00:31:06 <Camail> dub the next d3 season is so boring
00:31:36 <Camail> it's just a the no-set set bonus, but it's free
00:33:47 <Camail> i initially really like the idea of getting away from sets in d3, but it turns out the BiS turns into ancients with damage buffs
00:34:09 <Camail> there's just as little creativity or individuality in the best legendaries as there are in the set bonuses
00:34:45 <Camail> d3 is utterly incapable of letting the playerbase be creative, just doesn't have the tools
00:35:08 <Camail> which makes me mad because i really really liked so much about that game
01:00:17 <DuB`> Aha
01:00:30 <DuB`> I hadn't seen the new LoN season, thought it was the RoRG one
01:00:32 <DuB`> Hmmm
01:00:42 <DuB`> Farming ancient legendaries is... a lot
01:01:44 <DuB`> Er, I was thinking of primal ancients. So a lot but not ridiculous haha
01:02:18 <DuB`> I'll have many a freetime, may hop in
01:04:57 <Bio> get a jerb u slakr
01:05:04 <BioSleep> nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
01:05:16 <DuB`> I DID, bio!
01:05:18 <DuB`> nn
01:05:29 <BioSleep> n
01:05:54 <Camail> yea rorg is s16
01:05:58 <Camail> s17 is lon
01:09:03 <DuB`> I've yet to play fully through a crus or necro, would be worth doing that at least
01:09:20 <Camail> the only reason i can make any claims about LoM being a disappointment is beecause there are already top tier builds that use it, and they aren't terribly interesting
01:09:42 <Camail> the current top tier crus build uses lon so that'd be a good choice
01:09:54 <DuB`> Hmm
01:10:08 <Camail> it's gonna be the same set but with 2 ancient rings
01:10:16 <Camail> probably SoJ and something else
01:10:49 <Camail> convention of elements, probably
01:10:53 <Camail> if you dont cube it

18:52:54 <Camail> i played a bit last night, god damn i was rusty

18:59:11 <Camail> dot
18:59:26 <Rawr|Fone> Good evening
19:00:29 <Runbunny> Camail, I thought about it as well. I figured that I could just hunting horn.
19:00:51 <Runbunny> Because goddamn hunting horn really toots my horn.
19:01:08 <Camail> i have a the legiana bow for area 4
19:01:22 <Camail> but yea i'm just using my LS but with part break and bombadier in area 1-3
19:01:42 <Camail> considering bombadier is effectively a 60% buff
19:04:05 <Runbunny> I want to do it. But I can't of don't want to HBG, LBG or Bow.
19:04:15 <Runbunny> Because, idk.
19:05:52 <Camail> well you dont need range if your party is doing area 4 well
19:06:13 <Camail> either your getting trips on the front legs, or you are getting a mount and ko/para/koing
19:06:23 <Camail> and that lets melee do a ton of horn famage
19:06:38 <Camail> i just like bow so i'm cool with it
19:07:35 <Runbunny> Maybe I should give it a go. It's just a stronger KT right?
19:07:42 <Camail> also you dont need partb break vs the horns
19:07:49 <Camail> so its good to have a different deco set regardless
19:08:02 <Camail> thre's a video with the differences
19:11:33 <Runbunny> but that is only for the horns right? in part 4.
19:14:32 <Camail> yea area 1-3 are the same, but she has a set beginning position in area 1
19:15:03 <Camail> also status resistances are way higher
19:15:17 <Camail> you can't chain as much
19:15:23 <Camail> so you get 1 sleep and 1 para
19:15:32 <Runbunny> My sekiro conditioning is going to have me do a bunch of unfortunate heavy attacks.
19:15:44 <Runbunny> oh right. 
19:16:01 <Runbunny> I think my horn is sleep, but it might be hidden element.
19:16:20 <Camail> its probably hidden
19:16:32 <Camail> also you dont want sleep in 1-3 anyway
19:19:27 <Camail> there's a lot more leniency if you aren't going for p1
19:21:58 <Runbunny> It's less rewards then? or just slower?
19:22:09 <Camail> less rewards
19:22:14 <Runbunny> MEh.
19:22:17 <Camail> you get a bonus 2 rainbow boxes if ouy p1
19:22:23 <Camail> but these are rewards above and beyond
19:22:46 <Camail> its a reward for doing something harder
19:23:23 <Camail> can hunting horn mount well?
19:24:05 <Runbunny> It's just 2 boxes less? Or is that the only way to get rainbow boxes?
19:24:18 <Camail> there are a few ways to get them
19:24:23 <Runbunny> The jump attack is pretty cool.
19:24:35 <Camail> p17, killing while enraged
19:24:58 <Runbunny> Gives a good meaty thunk when you clap someone poor bloke on the head.
19:25:15 <Camail> there are a few others but i forget
19:25:32 <Runbunny> Sounds bothersome.
19:25:39 <Camail> also at kt does a lot of damage
19:25:43 <Runbunny> I'd just grind it out, if possible.
19:26:13 <Camail> rainbow boxes have a really really good rarity distribution for drops
19:26:44 <Runbunny> I just want me some Kjarr weapons.
19:27:28 <DuB`> omg
19:27:35 <DuB`> OW workshop coming
19:27:47 <DuB`> Whatever-you-want custom games n stuff
19:28:13 <DuB`> https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5&v=naPxnU2-4no
19:29:01 <Camail> i'm not terribly interested in kjarr weapons, just mildly better than some other weapons
19:29:19 <Camail> i just want to hunt at kt
19:30:00 <Camail> also, hoping for drops tends to ruin the fun of the game
19:30:00 <Runbunny> Well if I get a powerful weapon, it's like I am powerful.
19:30:13 <Camail> any time i was grinding for drops was just me spending time being sad
19:30:18 <Runbunny> I mean yeah, it's the bonus
19:30:30 <Runbunny> It's the thrill of the hunt!
19:31:22 <Camail> i'm also warming up for the festival so i can do the ats i missed
19:31:32 <Camail> other than extremoth, still fuck that
19:31:33 <Runbunny> It's the moments, I did a slide -> jump attack with a hunting horn on a monster that was just taking off, knocking it down.
19:31:50 <Runbunny> Random in my party was so impressed he wrote it in the chat.
19:51:33 <Zounds> cool DuB`

19:53:50 <DuB`> If I can figure it out...
20:01:01 <Zounds> I'd play it
20:01:28 <Zounds> reminds me of "pop a cap" from perfect dark
20:01:41 <Zounds> you gotta work together to kill the guy but also kill each other so you can finish him off
