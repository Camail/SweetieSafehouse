09:49:51 <Runbunny> Hai Bio.
09:50:02 <Runbunny> Isn't it crazy early for you?
09:50:03 <BioPhone> Imma going to the plane place
09:50:07 <Runbunny> Ah
09:50:14 <BioPhone> Only 6am, so yes
09:50:45 <Dot|Phone> Runbun, I saw blizzard has disabled ppl deleting thier accounts
09:50:52 <Dot|Phone> Hey bio 
09:50:54 <Runbunny> Yeah apparently.
09:51:13 <Dot|Phone> Blizzard done goofed 
09:52:16 <reification> i don't think that's how data protection laws work
09:54:09 <Dot|Phone> They also had mass walk out of its employees
09:54:43 <Dot|Phone> It didn't say they quit, so just refusing to work I guess
10:02:57 <Runbunny> Everyone is really mad right now.
10:03:23 <Runbunny> But the next thing will happen and the internet mob will jump on that.
10:06:19 <reification> that is common bun, however i expect the hong kong situation to continue to receive major coverage
10:06:33 <reification> cf france/iraq

18:41:52 <skram> what ever you plan we're probably gonna do the opposite of it anyway
18:41:52 <Camail> welcome to why i stopped DMing
18:44:03 <Dot`> ive tried getting them to talk between sessions and even straight asked what they plan to do or try
18:44:06 <Dot`> and nothing
18:44:18 <Dot`> so every week i plan hours and hours of content that doesnt get used
18:45:03 <Dot`> most of the time i dont mind as i can use it elsewhere
18:45:13 <Dot`> but im just tired
18:48:45 <Rawr|Phone> Dot dot

18:49:06 <Dot`> <3
18:50:23 <Rawr|Phone> ‚ù§
18:53:37 <Camail> prepping every week made DMing unfun, every once in awhile i try and think about how to make prep fun
18:54:41 <Camail> the prep has to satisfy my creative urges, and i don't quite know which parts of prep do that
18:55:14 <Dot`> thats why i thought running a west marches would work, a lot of prep up front but after that its easy, and its player driven, they come to you with what they want
18:55:57 <Dot`> but then i only got 3, and it needs about 6+. then i go to run wwaterdeep and have to turn ppl away and stull have 6
18:56:06 <Camail> it's a bit to structured for me, going out on Missions to Places doesn't satisfy me
18:56:27 <Camail> and it doesn't help that i play a different style than everyone here
18:56:46 <Camail> so i dont think i can be a player in tlp dnd
