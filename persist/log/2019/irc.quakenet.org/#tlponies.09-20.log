09:57:27 <Runbunny> So I don't know really.
09:58:14 <DoT|Phone> install fanspeed?
10:01:10 <Runbunny> For some reason only my CPU fan show up in my BIOS.
10:01:18 <Runbunny> What is fanspeed?
10:01:34 <Runbunny> Is that some engineer secret application?
10:02:30 <DoT|Phone> a free program that tracks pc temps and can control fan speed

14:02:20 <DuB|fon> I did a buy
14:02:26 <Runbunny> I personally played with kb + m
14:02:47 <Runbunny> Which is fine, but it's probably better on a controller
14:02:51 <Runbunny> Like Dark souls I guess.
14:03:13 <DuB|fon> Interest
14:03:15 <DuB|fon> Oke
14:04:01 <Runbunny> Should be down to preference.
14:05:02 <Runbunny> Not like dark souls 2 where all your attacks with mouse is delay because it has to be ready in case you double tab for heavy attacks

21:27:50 <skram> i dont even know what the pale court is, uncle cma
21:28:12 <DuB`> I will give you um
21:28:16 <Camail> do atlas, unlock mud geyser, buy feral lord V prophecies, sell keys
21:28:39 <Camail> 13c profit per key
21:28:53 <DuB`> Hmm the only games I'm rich in are warframe and runescape and I don think anyone cares about those
21:29:18 <DuB`> Off to learn the monhuns now, I think!
21:29:18 <Camail> i make most of my money in syndicate
21:29:31 <Camail> dub if you have questions i can try to remember the answer
21:29:46 <Camail> first tip: make honey
21:30:13 <DuB`> First question: Ok?
21:30:25 <DuB`> I'mma just whack the mons
21:30:33 <DuB`> whacka whacka
21:30:59 <Camail> mega potions are crucial
21:32:26 <Camail> low rank is very easy, you can just kill things for the first 40 hours of the game
21:34:21 <DuB`> Perfec
21:36:59 <DuB`> Oh lucky
21:37:12 <DuB`> The game went off of 50% sale today, I bought last night right before bed
21:37:15 <DuB`> Phew
21:37:40 <DuB`> Guess I won't be tempting any other friends to get it and start with me though lol
21:53:01 <Camail> its gonna go on sale again at some point
21:53:28 <DuB`> But I'm starting noowwww
21:53:31 <DuB`> (After foods)
21:53:37 <Camail> yea, and they can start later
21:54:11 <Camail> i could play with you, put some default gear on
21:54:41 <Camail> skram also selling rares is a good consistent money maker, but you need to know how to do it
21:55:00 <Camail> and picking up common, but important, uniques and seeing if they have good rolls
21:57:40 <Camail> i've been planning to write a short guide kind of thing about getting into the trade market in poe
21:58:11 <Camail> still trying to figure out the shape of it, it's aimed at beginners so it's hard to hone down
22:03:18 <DuB`> .choose berger pizza
22:03:21 <DuB`> wew
