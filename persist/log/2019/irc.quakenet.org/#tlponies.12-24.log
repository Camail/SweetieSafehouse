11:13:29 <reification> ah hello rial <3
11:13:34 <Rial> Hey hey
11:13:39 <Rial> <3
11:14:00 <reification> wait it isn't christmas in japan yet is it?
11:14:15 <Rial> It's the 24th 8:20 PM
11:14:37 <reification> i must have gotten my times messed up with steam, oh well
11:14:55 <Rial> Don't worry, I'll pretend I saw nothing
11:15:32 <reification> will you be having fried chicken today, i believe that is the appropriate tradition?
11:16:34 <Rial> My roomie is on a diet. We'll opt for roast chicken instead =w=
11:16:47 <Rial> But yes, KFC is already trending on JP Twitter
11:17:37 <reification> i shall have roast duck tomorrow but that is only a family tradition not a english one
11:18:48 <Rial> I remember eating duck before. It tasted like ham
11:20:35 <reification> it may depend on preparation but roast duck should have a lot of crispy skin
11:20:57 <reification> so not the best for your roommate
11:26:06 <reification> it's nice to have you here again rial, i have missed your streams, though i can understand you've been otherwise occupied
11:26:38 <reification> also your art has improved a lot, i especially liked this fox https://twitter.com/z32o/status/1204528486062276608
11:27:32 <Rial> I had to reinstall mIRC and dug out my registration code, and remember how to get here, but here I am, lol
11:28:21 <Rial> I'm glad you like it! I've been taking this holiday break to update my things on the social media part and all of that stuff. 
11:28:23 <reification> ah quite the journey
11:28:51 <Rial> I miss streaming too, to be honest
11:33:11 <reification> you always impressed me with your ability to play and talk to chat at the same time
11:33:25 <reification> my multitasking isn't really up to streaming
11:34:36 <Rial> You're making me red =w=
11:34:55 <Rial> I was pretty terrible at it at the beginning
11:41:42 <reification> i shall go get the exercise i missed out on yesterday. back in a bit
11:42:04 <Rial> Good luck!
11:55:58 <Runbunny> Shower time.

22:31:27 <skram> what about pudding?
22:34:07 <Zounds> the aptly named christmas pudding is often the pudding at christmas
22:34:14 <Zounds> we tend to eat a trifle though
22:34:18 <Zounds> if we have dessert
22:36:04 <skram> sounds like a good time, zounds
22:36:32 <Zounds> turkey is nice but its the stuffed that served with it I love
22:36:49 <Zounds> the stuffing, the sprouts, the sausages wrapped in bacon called pigs in blankets
22:36:55 <Zounds> and especially the roast potatoes
22:37:58 <skram> dont think ive ever had stuffed turkey
