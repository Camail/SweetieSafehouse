00:24:13 <Camail> if it's like autochess in that regard, you don't have to care until your facing good players
00:24:49 <Camail> it's much more important for you to build an economy than to go into whats open
00:29:36 <Camail> the LoL autochess looks like trash
00:29:50 <Camail> i know nothing of the game itself, it just looks really bad and cheap
00:46:19 <motbob> it looks impossible to play if you don't know LoL
00:46:42 <motbob> having played dota, i have no idea if dota chess is impossible to play if you don't know dota
00:46:52 <motbob> *underlords
00:49:04 <Bio> they are pretty separate games imo]
00:50:01 <motbob> i get the feeling that dota heroes are more distinct on first glance, but again, i'm hopelessly biased
00:50:19 <motbob> whenever i watch LoL, the heroes are way too small and i can't tell what they're supposed to be at all
00:50:31 <motbob> maybe it's different in the auto chess game

15:46:41 <Camail> i managed to get to mapping with my ed/con boy last night
15:47:41 <Camail> i stayed up waaaaay too late because i really wanted to beat the story in a single day

15:49:09 <Cane> Oh damn, good work dude.
15:49:20 <Cane> I've got my Cont/ED dude in maps now.
15:49:36 <Cane> It was fun showing my friend around.
15:52:32 <Cane> Are you using that Sash you found?
15:56:45 <DoT|Phone> you did all 10 acts in 1 day?
16:00:55 <Cane> The best players can do it in a few hours.
16:01:20 <Camail> i'm not using it, i'd rather sell it to an ele melee character
16:01:59 <DoT|Phone> that's still pretty crazy cam.
16:02:13 <Camail> and yea dot, i had some levelling gear that made it easier
16:02:25 <Camail> but i also went quite fast
16:03:05 <DoT|Phone> so much zooms
16:03:23 <Camail> going from 2 weeks on my first char, to 1 day on my 5th
16:04:01 <Camail> also, only one death, but it was a really dumb death to beastiary monsters that were lvl 81
16:04:10 <Camail> so i dont count that one
16:04:24 <DoT|Phone> nice
16:04:34 <Camail> ed/con is a really really safe build
16:04:50 <Camail> its so easy to clear all of a monolith
16:25:50 <Cane> The Legion is ED/Cont's bitch.

18:35:51 <Runbunny> Hai Zounds.
18:35:56 <Runbunny> I am behind.
18:36:09 <Zounds> what are you behind?
18:36:18 <Runbunny> The curve.
18:36:29 <Zounds> Ahh that's my natural habitat
18:36:41 <Runbunny> Oh.
18:37:02 <Runbunny> I'm sure that I'll make it to 70 before Shadowbringers hit.
18:37:10 <Zounds> Oh that curve
18:39:20 <Zounds> That curve isn't that important. even if you're a bit late reaching ShB stuff you'll miss the initial rush which is likely a good thing
18:40:09 <Zounds> unless you were planning to become the next ultimate legend raider sensation
18:41:25 <Runbunny> I don't think I have that in me anymore. 
18:41:34 <Zounds> I sure as hell don't
18:42:05 <Runbunny> I hardcore raided in vanilla, but that was super unoptimized, so took forever.
18:42:47 <Zounds> It's the domain of teenagers and NEETs
18:43:20 <Zounds> And I don't say that with scorn at all
18:45:42 <Camail> runbun how goes that CI build
18:46:44 <Zounds> Speaking of teenagers and NEETs how goes the PoE cam
18:47:04 <Zounds> The top players of those games are hella hardcore
18:47:40 <Zounds> cut from the same cloth as the MMO raiders I think
18:48:52 <Camail> yea, they typically stay awake for 30-40 hours on league start
18:49:51 <Camail> the poe is fun, definitely slowing down
18:52:11 <Runbunny> Zounds, I'm a NEET now

20:52:35 <Cane> Runbunny, what stuff do you need on a 6l armor?
20:52:40 <Cane> I've never done CI.
20:53:07 <Camail> pure shield
20:53:13 <Camail> as much shield and int as possible
20:54:01 <Cane> Camail, I joined the found-a-6-link club five minutes ago. An incredibly shitty corrupted rare dropped that had like 3 life, some strength, no resistances...
20:54:09 <Cane> It was less hype than I expected.
20:54:19 <Camail> yea, it's the entry bar, apparently
20:54:29 <Camail> i got mine in uber lab in flashback
20:55:25 <Camail> also it's preffered if you can get the veiled mod for energy shield recharge on some items
20:57:47 <Cane> I bought this 4 minutes before 6-linking my Belly of the Beast. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/586603839377899533/592820554902536194/unknown.png
20:58:05 <Cane> This season has been a little troll.
20:58:24 <Camail> how much was that?
20:58:48 <Cane> Pretty cheap, ~20-25 chaos or something.
20:59:20 <Cane> I guess I can give it to some TLP people if anyone needs it. Otherwise I'll probably just sell it for ~20.
20:59:31 <Camail> wow, people really aren't going hybrid witch apparently
21:00:31 <Camail> my trickster 6l cost 25 and it was worse than that
21:00:57 <Cane> When did you buy that though? This was earlier this morning, prices probably dropped.
21:01:10 <Camail> well i just created my trickster yesterday
21:01:13 <Cane> Huh.
21:01:21 <Cane> Maybe I got lucky and someone underpriced it. I dunno.
21:01:24 <Camail> high evasion gear is meta
21:01:31 <Camail> witch is not
21:01:45 <Camail> it's just in higher demand
21:02:03 <Camail> high evasion is very important for trickster so everyone is grabbing it
21:15:51 <Runbunny> Yeah what Camail said.
21:16:31 <Runbunny> Flat ES, %ES, some resists if possible, but it quickly gets expensive.
