19:21:23 <Dot`> Vakist
19:21:29 <skram> perfect
19:22:01 <skram> that'd just be a regular pillow with a print on it though
19:22:05 <reification> seems like there's an offer on if you can't decide skram (site may have nsfw) https://www.animedakimakurapillow.com/pages/buy-3-dakimakura-get-1-free-dakimakura
19:22:49 <skram> i dont know any of these characters tbh
19:23:10 <skram> bit spicy tho??
19:23:22 <reification> i think you can choose any you want
19:24:35 <reification> also i'm surprised you haven't seen any of gurren lagann, re:zero or konosuba
19:25:00 <skram> i did recognize explosion person yes
19:27:29 <reification> if you liked kill la kill you really should watch gurren lagann
