17:52:32 <Camail> skram can you carry me in merc lab
17:52:54 <skram> i mean i can try
17:53:12 <skram> i dont think im a lot stronger than when you carried me
17:53:34 <Camail> i just need you to kill izaro
17:53:46 <Camail> you can do that pretty easily
17:54:11 <skram> sure but dont yell at me when i panick in the spike trap and die

18:05:24 <DoT`> animemes
18:06:14 <Runbunny> Dot got isekai'ed?
18:06:41 <DuB`> If I blacked out and woke up in bakewell I'd probably assume it's isekai
18:08:32 <DoT`> does that make scotland and london the both high level areas?
18:08:40 <Runbunny> Dub is actually an expert.
18:08:55 <DuB`> At what??
18:10:52 <Runbunny> Isekai.

20:32:25 <Camail> or at least blackmail your boss
20:32:45 <skram> then what is problem
20:32:53 <Camail> he is coward
20:32:57 <Camail> that is a well known fact
20:33:01 <skram> use credit card, buy 2080ti, pay when the collection company comes to break your kneecaps
20:33:19 <Camail> pay with someone else's CC
20:33:23 <skram> even better
20:33:25 <Runbunny> Oh.
20:33:28 <DuB`> Aha
20:33:31 <Runbunny> Clever.
20:33:38 <DuB`> So skram I need to to go grab your wallet
20:33:56 <Runbunny> Jonas doesn't have a credit card.
20:33:57 <skram> I dont have as credit card actually
20:34:28 <Runbunny> In his part of the land, the only valid currency is trading chickens.
20:34:33 <DuB`> Well that's no help
20:34:41 <DuB`> How many chickens is a 2080
20:34:48 <Runbunny> Too many.
20:35:11 <skram> Well. We dont have a currency, its a barter system
20:35:14 <DoT`> skram cant trust himself enough to own a credit card
20:35:22 <DoT`> he would have no kneecaps already
20:35:46 <skram> Why would I own a credit card though
20:36:00 <DuB`> Maybe I'll just go get some nice ramen tonight instead
20:36:05 <DuB`> I know for sure I can afford that!
20:36:20 <DoT`> thinkn how much anime stuff you could buy skram
20:36:25 <DoT`> with money you dont even have
20:36:47 <Crisium> credit card rewards yo
20:36:58 <skram> Thats not a thing.
20:37:02 <Crisium> it is in murica
20:37:13 <skram> Actually it is useful for when traveling abroad for fraud protection
20:37:15 <skram> thats about it
20:37:40 <skram> and the credit score system doesnt exist in norway, at least
20:37:47 <DoT`> oh?
20:37:52 <Crisium> i get hundreds of dollars in cash back per year.  in buying things i would buy normally that don't cost more with credit, with auto pay in full
20:37:53 <skram> or it does, but its based on taxes filed which is public info
20:38:15 <DoT`> i should move to norway, i ahve never had a credit card, and this is apparently REALLY AWEFULL, becuase it means i buy things i have money for
20:38:54 <Crisium> only debt i have ever had is student loan and car loan, actually using credit card for credit is dumb
20:39:10 <DuB`> Ya
20:39:12 <DuB`> I basically just use mine as a debit card
20:39:43 <Crisium> if you have the discipline to not spend extra, auto pay in full, and make sure you dont buy things that cost extra with credit cards, its just free rewards
20:40:13 <skram> well thats pretty smart then
20:40:19 <Crisium> it is biggest brain
20:40:30 <DoT`> but the system is dumb still
20:40:31 <Crisium> of course many ppl probably dont have the discipline
20:40:36 <Crisium> and should run away
20:41:44 <Runbunny> reification, Dumbbell anime starts tomorrow.
20:41:59 <reification> !
20:42:48 <skram> Cris, people employed in norway get a bonus on their last paycheck before summer every year which is a fair bit
20:42:55 <skram> so people use that to pay off their credit card loans
20:43:12 <skram> but now they're broke so they use their credit cards to pay for their vacation
20:43:15 <skram> perfectly balanced
20:43:39 <DuB`> Hah
20:44:10 <Crisium> is Norway like Sweden where half the country doesnt work for 5 weeks
20:44:41 <skram> no its half the country for 3 weeks
20:44:47 <skram> then the other half the next 3 weeks
20:44:54 <Crisium> nice
20:45:15 <DoT`> norway is so weird
20:45:42 <DuB`> Hmm there's actually a highly-rated pc repair place on my same block, might just take my gpu over to them and have them test it. Might narrow issue down to it or mobo or somethin
20:45:47 <DuB`> Or just give up and buy new one :P'
20:45:49 <Crisium> also doesnt norway have like infinite money in their trust fund
20:45:54 <Crisium> from all the oil
20:47:19 <skram> its only 1,08x10^12 dollars
20:47:49 <Crisium> how can i get this money
20:48:14 <skram> if you were a rainforest you might get some
20:48:40 <Crisium> what if i raze a rainforest to the ground?
20:48:54 <reification> invade and take it
20:50:43 <Crisium> pretty sure theres a movie based on if Russia invades Norway for the oil and the monies
20:51:45 <skram> eh oil's pretty much gone at this point
20:53:02 <Crisium> just dig deeper
20:53:12 <Crisium> im sure the core of the earth is all oil
20:53:17 <skram> Theres so many toll booths between sweden and the capital so they're gonna be bankrupt by the time they get there anyway
20:55:38 <skram> Do you have any idea how expensive it is to toll a T90 through ring3? Its gonna put them in debt for years!
