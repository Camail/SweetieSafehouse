01:28:30 <Camail> buy a decent unique and flip it?
01:28:56 <Camail> sit in the instance and hunt for a good deal on something
01:29:33 <Camail> look for something an ED or a cyclone build uses, maybe
01:49:45 <Cane> Item go poof.
01:49:51 <Cane> Slightly anticlimatic.

08:09:05 <DoT`> Bun
08:17:26 <Camail> dot, runbun
08:17:30 <Camail> it's working
08:17:37 <Camail> i am making so much money
08:18:01 <Camail> no one realizes prophecies + maps are way cheaper than pale fragment
08:18:11 <Camail> like 80% profit margin
08:18:37 <DoT`> lol
08:19:05 <Camail> 2c for the prophecy, i have maps to trade for geyser, sell for 12c
08:19:09 <Camail> sold 7 so far
08:19:46 <Camail> 8
08:22:07 <Runbunny> O:
08:26:09 <Camail> well, gotta wait for prophecies to replenish
08:26:21 <Camail> but if you set up the right live feeds you could be running this thing really efficiently
08:26:40 <Camail> the long part is getting trades
08:26:55 <Camail> you could be making a ton of ex per hour if you had a smooth intake of resources
08:30:34 <Camail> Runbunny the volkuur's key market is wide open if you wanna grab that

09:21:30 <Golly> classic
09:21:49 <Golly> liquid looking stronger these days tho
09:51:56 <Cane> I've been curious to see how w33 will perform.
09:56:59 <Camail> made an ex from reselling, took about an hour, but there was a ton of downtime
09:57:10 <Camail> i could try seeing how selling pale court sets works out
10:00:42 <Camail> gonna try that after some sleep
10:00:53 <Cane> This is a solid game.
10:01:03 <Camail> if it works the profits almost double
10:16:21 <Golly> terrorblade good hero

18:07:52 <skram> would you like an egg in these trying times
18:08:09 <DuB`> If an egg is a fresh 1070 then yus
18:08:46 <skram> hmm
18:15:38 <DuB`> Yesterday reinstalling drivers and restarting worked, now it is just ded
18:15:57 <DuB`> There are lights working on the card, at least...
18:19:39 <Golly> remember, red light for fast, blue for cool, and green for eco
18:19:54 <Golly> thats how computers work i think
18:22:17 <skram> hmm
18:22:26 <skram> thats how cars work at least
18:22:59 <Golly> i thought the car system was more decal based
18:23:43 <skram> one of the company cars where i work has a green button for eco and a red button for FAST
18:23:46 <skram> no blue buttons iirc
18:24:30 <Golly> skimping on the catapult seat button, tsk tsk
18:25:13 <Golly> granted a fast button doesnt sound like a company option
18:25:38 <skram> Well its a hybrid so it totally fits the profil (bioenergy)
18:26:23 <skram> never mind that its got 204 hp
18:26:33 <Golly> dafuk
18:27:08 <Golly> at work im lucky if i get a hot dog
18:28:30 <skram> Well its just a golf so its a lot cheaper to lease than a vw transporter or even a caddy
18:30:19 <Golly> not sure i understand why a caddy would be expensive, seems like a ripoff
18:30:27 <Golly> cant you buy a used one for like nothing
18:31:42 <skram> well maybe not so expensive but the sort of combivan things are stupid popular

18:50:29 <DoT`> oh, you have a onboard 1080 graphics?
18:50:34 <DoT`> im confused
18:50:50 <DoT`> does your card only have 1 port?
18:50:55 <DoT`> #thats also weird

18:52:32 <DuB`> There's the dvi right out the back of the gpu which I have my 144hz monitor on, then hdmi and another dvi together with usb etc off of the mobo?
18:53:40 <DoT`> im so confused....
18:54:09 <DoT`> any graphics ports on the mb should be part of the onboard card
18:54:23 <DoT`> and the card obviosly has its own ports
18:54:31 <DoT`> but those ratios seem backwards
18:54:45 <skram> take a pciture pal
18:54:47 <DoT`> normaly an independent card will have 3-5 ports
18:54:55 <DoT`> and the onboard will have 1 maybe 2
18:56:39 <Camail> yea the card should have one of everything
18:56:49 <DoT`> pull the little plugs out dub
18:57:08 <DoT`> the plastic dust protectors
18:57:10 <skram> haha yes
18:57:20 <skram> those are probably hdmi ports
18:57:22 <DuB`> Does hdmi do 144hz?
18:57:22 <DuB`> Ya
18:57:26 <skram> or those stupid apple things
18:57:36 <Camail> i use a display port for 144hz
18:57:40 <DoT`> and lol! you have a ps2 port
18:57:49 <DoT`> with the mouse/keybard colours
18:58:06 <skram> hdmi can do 120hz maybe
18:58:26 <Camail> generally speaking, it cant do 144
18:59:03 <skram> does the dvi port not work, DuB`
18:59:07 <DuB`> Nu
18:59:18 <skram> righto
18:59:21 <DoT`> well see if the hdmi on the board do
18:59:24 <DuB`> Plugged my hdmi 60hz monitor into the card and it does nothing
18:59:29 <DuB`> Board ports work fine
18:59:41 <DoT`> not the mb 
18:59:47 <DoT`> the video card
18:59:51 <DuB`> No those are ded
18:59:57 <DuB`> Hdmi and dvi
19:00:29 <DoT`> card is probably dead if it all worked before you shipped it
19:00:40 <DoT`> is there some kind of insurance?
19:00:51 <DuB`> Dunno
19:01:21 <DoT`> well if you have a second pc somewhere or a spare card yyou could start swapping parts to test things, but i dont think you do
19:01:30 <DuB`> Card shows up in device manager etc, I see now "Windows ahs stopped this dvice because it has reported problems"
19:01:33 <DuB`> Naw
19:01:51 <DoT`> turn pc off, remove card
19:02:01 <DoT`> UNPLUG PC before removing card
19:02:08 <DoT`> reseat it
19:02:21 <DoT`> click pc power button
19:02:25 <DoT`> plug pc back in
19:02:27 <DoT`> try
19:02:47 <skram> could also try to put card in an unused PCIE port of there is one?
19:03:04 <DoT`> can do that too
19:03:22 <DoT`> but im hoping it may just be loose from getting jogged in transport
19:03:55 <skram> that'd be the easiest
19:04:54 <DoT`> i hope he took notes

22:24:44 <skram> instant coffee is basically a human rights violation
22:26:20 <DoT`> also affordable
22:26:54 <skram> buddy you can get a french press for probably less than 10 pounds
22:27:14 <DoT`> and then the coffee!

23:11:05 <skram> thanks pals
23:11:13 <skram> hey runbun
23:11:19 <skram> forget about your catgirl research
23:11:23 <Runbunny> I learned that there's a redpanda pet you can get in FFXIV.
23:11:25 <skram> i need you to look into bird girls
23:11:37 <reification> ?crow
23:11:47 <Runbunny> and the pet can crawl an your shoulder and all.
23:11:47 <reification> ?crowgirl
23:11:56 <Runbunny> What kind of bird girl Jonas?
23:12:12 <CockRoach|42> is birdgirl better than catgirl?
23:12:29 <skram> a crow, runbun
23:12:36 <reification> .r crow https://imgur.com/gallery/ko5Wq
23:12:46 <skram> almost
23:12:49 <skram> needs to be more emo
23:14:46 <Runbunny> Something like this? https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Z-9bibhkL._SY500_.jpg
23:14:46 <Zounds> how's the dancing going Runbunny 
23:15:00 <skram> anders thats a seagull
23:15:14 <Runbunny> A seagull is a bird.
23:15:41 <Runbunny> Dancing is fine, but I think I need like lvl 77 for it really to take off.
23:17:15 <Zounds> 77? oh dear ^^
23:18:12 <Zounds> warrior is the same as it was before but with even bigger buttons to press
23:18:17 <Zounds> I'm a fan
23:20:17 <reification> skram if wings are enough try haibane renmei's reki https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=reki+haibane+renmei&tbm=isch&source=hp
23:20:53 <skram> its in the top 50 of my list reif
23:21:23 <reification> so should be done in a month or two with your new weeb level?
23:21:40 <skram> ...
23:21:42 <skram> probably
23:24:03 <skram> actually ive been reading a shit ton of mangas since you linked that website that had all of them
23:25:02 <reification> anything good?
23:26:45 <skram> ive decided to read every isekai ever made
23:26:47 <skram> so not really, no
23:28:26 <reification> that seems unwise
23:28:49 <Runbunny> Zounds, it's not too bad as you start at 60. But right now it's cascade -> flowing cascade (if it procs) else it's just some other skill which also have a proc.
23:29:39 <Runbunny> The procs can then also proc, to give you fan stuff, which can proc can give you fan III.
23:29:56 <Runbunny> Exactly the same for AoE.
23:30:04 <skram> well theres komisan reif
23:31:01 <skram> besides, 90% of everything is trash anyway so its better to get it out of the way first
23:32:05 <DuB`> skram, the very best are the "reincarnated as a villainess noble" isekai sub-sub-genre
23:32:40 <skram> im currently on the "reincarnated as a monster/animal" genre
23:32:42 <reification> what about a slime or a vending machine?
23:33:01 <skram> there was one about an OP spider, and one about an OP bear
23:33:08 <skram> pls, the slime one is actually good
23:33:12 <skram> tell me about the vending machine though
23:33:30 <reification> i don't know i haven't read it, i just remember hearing about one
23:34:21 <skram> its not on mangadex
23:34:25 <reification> also there's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_You_Love_Your_Mom_and_Her_Two-Hit_Multi-Target_Attacks%3F
23:35:29 <reification> my bad the vending machine one is only a light novel atm
23:35:37 <reification> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reborn_as_a_Vending_Machine,_I_Now_Wander_the_Dungeon
23:36:18 <Runbunny> You could try www.exhentai.org Jonas.
23:36:32 <skram> anders
23:36:33 <skram> nei
23:38:08 <Runbunny> But look at how sad the panda is.
23:38:23 <skram> I bet you dont see any sad pandas when you click that
23:40:20 <skram> i'd like to keep my innocence intact
23:40:44 <DuB`> Your wha
23:41:31 <skram> pls
23:41:36 <skram> im a good christian boy from a furnished home
23:42:59 <Runbunny> We should ask Bio about your supposed innocence.
23:45:05 <reification> read this one skram https://mangadex.org/title/2554/saikyou-densetsu-kurosawa
23:45:39 <skram> these tags worry me
23:48:28 <reification> it's fine skram
23:48:39 <reification> runbun should read it too
23:49:59 <skram> well alright
23:50:42 <reification> well it's mad but great
23:53:23 <DuB`> Tonikaku Cawaii is my favo
23:53:27 <DuB`> Cute comfy
23:55:25 <reification> those are both good things
