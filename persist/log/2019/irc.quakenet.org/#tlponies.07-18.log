16:06:18 <Camail> yea i saw, it's nuts
16:06:26 <Camail> i didn't expect it to be as fatal as it was

21:46:41 <DuB`> I may need a psu upgrade to go with my gpu and monitor upgrade :P
21:47:14 <skram> it never friggin ends, dub
21:47:30 <DuB`> 600w is on the low edge of what might be okay for 2080
21:48:42 <DuB`> Also I think I'll need ta be choosin between 144hz 144op and 240hz 1080p...
21:48:49 <DuB`> 1440*
21:48:57 <DuB`> Fun fun
21:49:24 <skram> I dont know if theres a lot of difference between 144 and 240hz
21:49:49 <DuB`> Should be a difference of about... 96
21:49:54 <skram> ha ha
21:54:17 <Dot`> hey dubs
21:54:21 <DuB`> hey dots
21:54:39 <skram> dot, i repaired my car today
21:54:48 <DuB`> Looks like I'mma have to learn even more pc part put-togethering :P
21:54:56 <skram> now its making brand new noises that are way louder than before
21:55:00 <skram> im so good at things
21:55:15 <DuB`> Ah, you fixed the noisemaker then!
21:55:17 <DuB`> Good good
21:56:06 <skram> maybe i accidentally put a playing card in the spokes
21:56:23 <DuB`> You made a motorcycle!
21:57:31 <skram> but its got 4 wheels and goes beep bep!
21:58:16 <DuB`> motorsykkel
21:58:27 <skram> ja!
21:58:37 <skram> motorsykkels go vroom vroooom
21:58:54 <DuB`> Drive too far east and it'll be a –º–æ—Ç–æ—Ü–∏–∫–ª
21:59:02 <skram> da!
21:59:29 <DuB`> O so um
21:59:39 <DuB`> What do I need to know when picking 750w psu?
21:59:46 <DuB`> Do they all have the same plugs 'n stuff?
21:59:47 <skram> cross the ocean and its a „Ç™„Éº„Éà„Éê„Ç§
22:00:03 <skram> ehm if its a modular it should come with what you need
22:00:15 <DuB`> FULLY MODULAR
22:00:19 <DuB`> aka is legos?
22:00:25 <skram> yeh basically
22:00:39 <DuB`> Well if I pull my old one and nothing works I'll just ask again :P
22:01:20 <skram> your mobo needs a 20 or a 24 pin which is standard, dont know what a gpu needs
22:01:50 <skram> rest is just HDD power really
22:02:12 <DuB`> O great EVERYTHING plugs into it!
22:02:19 <DuB`> I'mma have to tear this whole things aparts
22:02:24 <skram> my 1080 needs a 6pin and a 8pin
22:02:50 <skram> if its a corsair it'll probably ship with all the things you need
22:03:12 <DuB`> I'm looking at EVGA Supernova 750 G2, nice $80
22:03:45 <skram> im not familiar with the brand but tomshardware probably has reviews and things
22:07:52 <DuB`> Ugh I've confused myself
22:10:01 <skram> how did that happen, buddy=
22:10:02 <skram> ?
22:10:07 <Dot`> good job skram, you have any spare parts?
22:10:25 <skram> course not, that would be a waste of money
22:10:31 <DuB`> What even is pins
22:10:32 <DuB`> :P
22:10:39 <DuB`> Legos are hard
22:10:47 <skram> its fine, dub
22:10:59 <skram> im 95% certain that it will fit
22:11:22 <DuB`> What the
22:11:35 <DuB`> Half the reviews on every psu I look at are "it fried my mobo and set things on fire"
22:12:10 <skram> GPU cards need power connectors, which have 6 or 8 pins, that PSU has 8-pin connectors where you can remove 2 pins so its gonna be fine
22:13:01 <DuB`> Hmm hmm
22:13:17 <DuB`> Well can't get other parts for a month or four anyway, so I'll just leave it at that
22:13:51 <skram> it'll be fine regardless
22:14:28 <skram> ive used corsair PSUs for a decade or something and i've never had issues
22:15:39 <DuB`> All my internal cables 'n stuff are wrapped neatly and hidden behind panels, gonna be a pain to redo it all methinks
22:16:07 <skram> cable management is the best part of computers!
22:16:12 <skram> its therapy for the SOUL
22:16:15 <skram> (sometimes)
22:18:57 <DuB`> OR
22:19:06 <DuB`> You could bump your NYC trip up to... this year! :P
22:19:27 <skram> HMM
22:19:29 <skram> do you have a futon
22:19:54 <DuB`> 2 air mattresses and a sofa which transformers into a bed
22:20:02 <skram> sold!
22:20:57 <DuB`> Could even stack all of them and have a wibbly wobbly tower of sleeps
22:21:51 <skram> if I leave tomorrow I can get a roundtrip from OSL to JFK for 900 dollarydoos
22:21:56 <skram> thats not even terribly expensive
22:22:11 <DuB`> I don't have my electronic legos yet!
22:22:18 <DuB`> Also it's hot here
22:22:31 <skram> i'd need a passport and a visa anyway
22:22:49 <DuB`> Yes unfortunately USA has neglected to join the EU
22:22:56 <Dot`> silly of them
22:23:10 <Dot`> they should rejoin the Great British Empire
22:23:47 <DuB`> I thought englando left that
22:24:02 <skram> The sun never sets on the british empire, dub
22:24:24 <DuB`> Sounds hot
22:24:33 <skram> terribly
