18:19:14 <skram> oh lol
18:20:07 <skram> wonderful
18:20:56 <Rawr|Phone> Just like you
18:21:03 <skram> knegg
18:21:04 <reification> skram i only found out the other day about this seasons isekai from the konosuba author (kemono michi)
18:21:34 <Rawr|Phone> I think the big problem for most people with the new game is that you won't be able to use all previous pokemon skram
18:21:47 <Rawr|Phone> But the latest news have been positive I think
18:21:59 <skram> but i only know the gen1 pokemans
18:22:05 <reification> ^
18:26:17 <skram> did you watch the bookworm one reif
18:26:28 <skram> it looks pretty wholesome
18:27:22 <Dot`> what is this rawr? will gen1 not be in the new game?
18:28:14 <skram> well weezing is gen1 so some of them are i guess
18:28:15 <Rawr|Phone> Some of them
18:28:34 <skram> hopefully they got rid of fuckin' snorlax
18:28:54 <Rawr|Phone> They haven't always had every single pokemon available in the game, but you could at least trade them in through other gamed
18:28:56 <Rawr|Phone> Games
18:29:06 <Rawr|Phone> You won't be able to with the new ones
18:29:22 <skram> hmm
18:29:37 <skram> do they not make a GBC/Switch link cable?
18:31:02 <Dot`> the switch has internets skram
18:31:05 <Dot`> why you want a cable
18:31:05 <Rawr|Phone> I think you can trade in old pokemon to the new games
18:31:14 <Rawr|Phone> But some pokemon will be locked I guess
18:31:28 <Rawr|Phone> People were not happy
18:31:28 <skram> Yes Dot`, by my gameboy from 1999 doesnt
18:31:31 <skram> but
18:31:47 <skram> depends which pokemans are unavailable i guess
18:32:05 <skram> if psyduck is gone who cares
18:32:21 <skram> if bulbasaur is gone then fuck nintendo 4ever
18:33:10 <Dot`> i need bulbasaur
18:33:11 <Dot`> always
18:33:28 <Dot`> can we mod it so he is a starter still pls
18:35:09 <Rawr|Phone> You can do that on any emulator dot
18:38:34 <Rawr|Phone> I usually do nuzlockes with either growlithe or ghastly
18:42:07 <Dot`> is nuzlockers a pokemon that isnt gen1?
18:42:51 <Rawr|Phone> It's a way to play the game dotpon
18:43:35 <Rawr|Phone> It makes the games more difficult and fun to play through several times
18:47:02 <Dot`> thats a lot of rules rawr
18:47:48 <Rawr|Phone> You can pick and choose what rules you want to apply 
18:48:01 <Rawr|Phone> There are pretty much only two that are required
